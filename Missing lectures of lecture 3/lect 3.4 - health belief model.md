Summary of the Health Belief Model Lecture:

The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a psychological model that explains and predicts health behaviors by focusing on the attitudes and beliefs of individuals. The key components of the HBM include:

1. **Perceived Susceptibility**: This refers to an individual's assessment of their risk of getting a condition or disease.

2. **Perceived Severity**: This relates to a person's belief about the extent of harm that a health condition can cause.

3. **Perceived Benefits**: The belief in the efficacy of the advised action to reduce risk or seriousness of impact.

4. **Perceived Barriers**: The individual's opinion about the financial and psychological costs of taking the advised action.

5. **Cue to Action**: The trigger required to turn intention into action.

6. **Self-Efficacy**: The level of an individual's confidence in their ability to successfully perform the behavior.

According to the model, these six factors can influence a person's motivation to engage in health behaviors. External factors like demographics (age, class, gender) and psychological factors (personality, peer pressure) can also impact these core beliefs.

For instance, in the context of COVID-19:

- **Threat Perception** can relate to how likely an individual believes they are to contract the virus and what the consequences would be.
- **Overall Health Motivation** pertains to how often someone engages in generally healthy behaviors, like focusing on hygiene.
- **Behavioral Evaluation** considers the benefits of engaging in preventive behaviors and the barriers to taking these actions.

The HBM has been applied to various healthcare domains, including preventive behaviors, adherence to medical regimens, and patient engagement with healthcare services. Effective use of the model involves communicating both the risk and the efficacy of preventive actions, along with providing a cue to action to motivate behavior change.

In conclusion, the HBM provides a framework for understanding how individuals make decisions about their health and the actions they take to prevent illness.

## Transcript

The health belief model. In this video, I will focus and explain the health belief model. So after this video, you should be able to explain the health belief model. The health belief model is about factors that influence people's health belief. And in a sense, then, whether they want to do a certain action that helps them to improve their health. Okay. Let's look at the model itself. So the model will have multiple factors influencing. So you have the action itself, which is preferable if you do it for your health, which is influence you. So you have three major parts that influence the action itself. So it's the threat perception. Do we think that we are vulnerable for this and how big is the threat? Then your overall health motivation. So your overall motivation to live healthily. And the last one is the behavioral evaluation. So of the behavior that you have to do, what's the benefit and how difficult is it to do this? And then these kinds of things are influenced by, for example, external factors like the demographic, your age, your class, your gender, but could also be influenced by your psychological characteristics, your personality, your peer group, pressure group, et cetera. So let's make it a bit more concrete. So COVID-19, wonderful example to pick. So threat perception. Do you perceive yourself to be susceptible that you will get COVID if you don't think it and then why bother? The next one, the perceived severity. What happens to you if you get it? Now together, that is the threat perception. So if you think it's likely that you can get it and if you have it, you might die or is it just one day it's over? Yes. Now together, that gives you a feeling how big the threat is that you have to react to. Now healthy, how healthy are your general or your behaviors to live healthily? Are you always already a clean person, focus on hygiene or is it something like I don't care about? Now then the other part, the behavioral evaluation, the perceived benefits. So what are the benefits if I deal with the threats? What are the benefits of not getting COVID-19? Are they small? It's like, all right, I can keep on working, social functioning if I do this or try to avoid the threat. And what are the barriers? If I have to social distance myself, wash my hands, can I still be interacting with other people or if I become isolated in my house? So that's sort of barriers that people perceive to start changing the behavior to increase their health and dealing with COVID-19. The actions. So you need to cue. And we've seen this before. We talked about what is triggering people to say, all right, now I should start changing my behavior. Is it a massive media? Do you see all this coverage on the news about COVID-19? You see maybe your relatives or friends getting affected. Now these can motivate you also to start changing your behavior. Now that is the health belief model. This has been applied already in many domains to list a few here, for example, for preventive behaviors. So not getting for screening. If you have genetic diseases, the risk that you get smoking or alcohol kind of diseases or related diseases, influenza vaccination, do people vaccinate and this kind of thing. These are things that have already started this model, but also the sick role and adherence to behavior. So sick role, what they refer to is if you're ill, then people, you have to play a certain role from society. So society expects that you get better, yes? And that you take steps and not just keep on going and get more ill. So that's a kind of a sick role that people are, or in a sense, adhere to ways to improve. Now diabetic regimes, renal disease regimes, so all this kind of, do people follow this? And then they started this with the health belief model. But also a clinic use, people come more often to the clinic for preventive measures or parental and children care, psychiatric care. So these are models where a situation has been studied with this model. In general, if you look at the health belief model, how do you use it now? How often it's been used is to make clear about the threat, that people understand there is a threat and that they're vulnerable, yes? And there's a risk and how big the risk is. But simultaneously, you also have to look at the other part. You also have to say how to, the actions can help them to prevent the risk. So only scaring people is not enough. You also have to give them an option to deal with this. And this combined message, that seems to be effective, yes? So make people aware about the risk and the severity and make them aware about what actions they can take and behavior that will reduce the threats, yes? And important, you can see again, here's the self-efficacy that people feel they have the capability of dealing with. And the other thing is also important that we see again is the cue to action, yes? There should be a trigger that motivates people to start changing their ideas about this. Okay, so in summary, the health belief model is the threat perception we have on one side, the other one is the behavioral evaluation. In the middle, we have this overall motivation people might already have and the cue to action. So this combined influence where the people would actually take steps that might be helpful for their health. Okay, see you in the next video.
