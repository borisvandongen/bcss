Summary:
Cognitive Dissonance is a psychological phenomenon where an individual experiences discomfort due to holding two contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors simultaneously. This discomfort leads to an internal pressure to resolve the inconsistency in order to re-establish mental harmony.

Cognitive Dissonance Examples:
1. A person claims to dislike the elderly but loves their elderly grandfather, causing dissonance that needs resolution.
2. A smoker who also wants to live healthily may avoid health warnings about smoking to reduce dissonance.

Resolution Strategies:
1. Avoidance of conflicting information.
2. Changing cognitions to align beliefs and behaviors.

Experiment Illustration:
An experiment by Cooper and others involved three groups in a weight reduction program: those who performed a difficult, high-effort task (reading tongue twisters), those who performed a low-effort task (simple reading), and a control group that did nothing. The high-effort group lost more weight due to their need to justify the effort already invested by maintaining their new health-oriented behaviors â€“ resolving cognitive dissonance by aligning actions with the perceived importance of health.

Application in Behavioral Change:
Cognitive dissonance can be used as a tool to persuade and influence behavior. For example, providing people with reasons to quit smoking and continually reinforcing the positive outcomes aligns with the desired behavior, encouraging the abandonment of the contradictory behavior (smoking).

Marketing Use:
The concept can be exploited to enhance sales by providing sufficient rationale for a purchase, thereby resolving any buying hesitation and reinforcing the decision post-purchase through quality packaging and additional perks. This also means highlighting the unique aspects of a product in comparison to competitors.

Example Scenario:
The video concludes with the example of Fiona who perceives university fees as too high but also recognizes the need for schools to have funds for education quality. Fiona must navigate through this cognitive dissonance by either avoiding the issue or adjusting her attitudes to find a comfortable rationale.

In summary, cognitive dissonance is a key psychological concept that explains the discomfort experienced when our actions and beliefs are out of alignment and describes how individuals may go through different processes to eliminate this discomfort and achieve psychological congruence.

Cognitive dissonance This video I will explain the concept of cognitive dissonance. Afterwards you should be able to explain this concept to others and also see how you might actually use it in your behavioral change support system. So what is cognitive dissonance? Cognitive dissonance is an unpleasant cognitive psychological state when people have two conflicting cognitions which are not aligned to each other. People don't like it. So for example I imagine that I say I don't like older people but I like my grandfather. So my grandfather is an old person but I don't like older people. So there is a cognitive dissonance. So I have to solve this in my mind because I want to be consistent in my reasoning. So something has to change. So there are two solutions that people often use when dealing with cognitive dissonance. One is to avoid information anymore. So for example I like smoking and I want to live healthy. That makes sense, yes? Smoking and living healthy is not. So people might then avoid images and information about that confirms again that smoking is unhealthy. Another thing that people can do is change their cognitions and make them aligned. So maybe I should quit smoking because if I want to be really healthy then it doesn't make sense that I still smoke because I want to be a rational person or you understand why people start ignoring information because they don't want to be in this unpleasant psychological state where they have conflicting ideas about the world or they start shifting one of those ideas which we can use to help people to change their mind to do something which might be more helpful for them. Interesting to understand how important cognitive dissonance is is one experiment that has been done by Cooperm and others. So they wanted to see what actually is the impact if you ask people to do a certain task in a weight reduction program. So they had a weight reduction program but they had three conditions. There was one in which people who ended up in this condition they had to do a 40 minute out loud tongue twisting text. Nothing to do with weight loss anyway but really difficult to read. And multiple times every week coming and doing this. Another condition is the low effort condition the other one is the high level, is they had to read also something much easier, shorter, less effort. And then the other group the control group, they only come in and wait. Now, interesting because in all three the things are low and the high effort, nothing to do with the weight loss but it's more effort or less effort they were doing. So what happens over time? So if you look at their weight changes, if you look at the numbers after three weeks, six weeks and one year, you see there is one group standing out. And that's the people who had the high effort. So they had to read those tongue twisters. Their weight loss is way larger than the other two conditions. And now you might say, why? Why would reading out those tongue twisters, difficult text, nothing to do with health or these things, make people lose more weight? Now, and here you get this cognitive dissonance going on. That's the explanation of this. Because if you think about it you went and you ended up in this condition. You did all those difficult reading all the week. So you make an effort and now you're home and you have to motivate yourself to do this health change thing. Now you think, yes, I put myself to all this effort where I am now. So yes, I want to keep going on because if I stop now, I lose everything I've done before and why would I have done that before? That seemed like a strange thing. And so I cannot convince myself of I just did it for some reason and I now stop doing it. So because you make this investment and you want to be consistent with your thinking I make this investment because now I want to lose weight. You're much more motivated to keep going with those weight effort. Compare that to a group who only went in every week to do a little bit of reading. So why would they continue? I mean, they could justify that the whole program was not really effective and they spent no time and didn't lose anything. So they really were not committed. So they can easily give it up. Yeah. So because they don't have to overcome cognitive dissonance because quitting now and less pay less effort in it is still consistent. So they didn't commit that much. So they also now don't have to put much effort in it. The other they really have put effort in it. So you should keep putting effort in it because apparently you find it important. Why did you do the other thing? Yes. Now here's you see how cognitive dissonance is operating. But you can also use it you see being used also in technology to persuade people. In the book again, Evil by Design, there's a whole section about this thing, how we can use this. And one of the arguments, if they look at the website is the point they make if you try to sell something, you have to convince the person that it's in line. You give them arguments why they should buy this. Yes. Because he or she might have this conflicting thing like, should I do this or not? So you should make sure that you are given enough arguments and reasons why to do it. So to help them to make a convincing case, if they have this conflict in their mind, should I buy it or not? You should give them so many arguments on they should buy it that they could shift their cognition on why the reason they should not buy it. So it says provide testimonial, review lifetime images, show a rosy future people do on the website. And he argues that it's not only important just to sell things or to make people do this behavior, but afterwards when they make this decision, reinforce it send the product in a nicely package and make sure that the new owner is aware of these items, why they bought it. Again, re-infer those actions or these beliefs that they should hold. The same if you want to change someone's behavior, therefore, if you want them to quit smoking give them enough reason why they should do it. Why? It says your breath is better, less lung diseases you feel more energetic, it also saves money. So you give more and more the weighting that they might have between those two conditions. One is more and more and more. Then you say, why am I smoking? I have all those arguments that I should quit smoking. And even when you quit, you reinforce it so you're on the good track. You see, you really have a new health style. You really love this and you feel now much better in the morning. So make sure people do this. And the other trick he explained is maybe the product itself is not that interesting. People have to buy it or your competitors also have that. So make sure there's something extra. So when you buy this, you get this little thing about it. Maybe that's not that relevant but now there's a difference between this product and the other because they are selling only this, but you get this and you can now tell how important the other item is. So again, give people these. So yeah, I know, but I went for this. This is so special. Also, the packaging apparently is good, important. Make sure that the whole thing looks good. Have good designs around it so people feel, yes, this is really a nice and beautiful thing. In the book, he gives, I think, an example about the axes that people were buying. So instead of showing like, oh, that's an axe. You can do some wood chopping there. No, no, it becomes an item to have to show what your identity is and that you have taste because it's also really a high quality axe. All this helps to persuade people and to make their cognitive dissonance to decide that you want to use it, that they change their belief on the other angle. It might be conflicting their cognition stopping from doing the behavior that you want to encourage them to do. Okay, to summarize it again. Cognitive dissonance. So here the example is Fiona's attitude. So Fiona's intuition fee is way too high for the University of Schools. But she might also think at the same moment schools need the money because they need to develop these wonderful kinds of education. So now they have a conflict and now Fiona has to solve this. So she might then shift and say, all right, maybe it's a good point that schools get some money or something. So if people have this conflict or they start avoiding the information or they start shifting one of these kinds of cognitions. Okay, that was the cognitive dissonance. I hope you enjoyed this video. See you in the next one!
