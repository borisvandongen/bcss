### Summary: Concept of Framing in Communication

**Defining Framing:**
- **Framing:** The process of creating a perspective or angle from which to view information or a situation. It is about how the same facts are communicated to influence emotions and perceptions.

**Effects of Framing:**
- The framing of a message can trigger different emotional responses in the audience.
- It can impact how individuals see themselves and their behavior (e.g., viewing oneself as active because of walking vs. not active for doing only a little walking).

**Applications of Framing:**
- **Political Context:** Political parties may frame an issue in different ways that lead to varying solutions or actions. For example, the 'war on drugs' suggests a severity requiring drastic measures, while framing drug use as a health issue suggests a need for rehabilitative solutions.
- **Emotional Trigger:** Framing that mentions loss (e.g., the risk of death) tends to have a stronger emotional impact due to 'loss aversion,' where losses are felt more intensely than gains.

**Types of Framing in Research:**
- **Gain Framing:** Emphasizes the benefits or positive outcomes one could achieve (e.g., using sunscreen for maintaining healthy skin).
- **Loss Framing:** Highlights what might be lost or the negative consequences that can be prevented (e.g., detecting cancer early to avoid adverse health outcomes).

**Behavioral Implications:**
- **Prevention Behaviors:** Gain-framed messages work better (e.g., promoting the use of sunscreen to prevent skin cancer).
- **Detection Behaviors:** Loss-framed messages are more effective (e.g., encouraging cancer screenings to avoid missing early treatment opportunities).

**Summary Conclusion:**
- The framing of a message has a significant impact on the emotional reaction and the response of the audience.
- The choice between gain and loss framing should be made based on the type of behavior (prevention or detection) being influenced.

**Closing Note:**
- Understanding framing is beneficial to tailor messages effectively, whether in personal interactions, health communications, or political campaigns.

framing. In this video I want to talk about the concept of framing. So after the video you should be able to understand how you could frame a message. And often we talk about you can positively frame it or negatively framing it. But basically you're still talking about the same facts. But the way you put a frame around it can influence how people see the world. So framing is about how you create a perspective on the world. So and how different people see things. So often you see in different groups in society might look at a different thing. So political parties might look at the same thing from a different angle. But that could also be individuals if they look at their own behavior. You could frame it differently. And that's important because how you frame things might trigger different emotions. So if I say I am an active person because I walk. Now that's already good because I'm doing a bit of walking. But you can also say I'm not a very active person. I only do a little bit of walking. Yes you still do the walking but it depends how you frame it. If it's not good enough or it's something. And that also helps. For example if you look at smoking. You could frame it like look I tried I failed so many times to quit smoking. Or you could frame it like all right smoking quitting is difficult. You already did two attempts. So on average you need three attempts. So you're almost there. Yes same facts. But you change the framing of the story. And that's important. You see it also in politics. So often when people talk about drug use you can frame it differently. So some groups frame it as the war on drugs. Now if you frame it as a war that says that you can use all kinds of resources now throw at it. Because in a war it's a crisis situations allow you to take drastic measures. Yes so if you frame it as a war that allows you in a sense to do much more. However if you frame the problem with drugs as a health problem then all of a sudden people start like all right now we have to come up with a solution to help the people to get rid of their addiction. Yeah same problem different frames different kinds of appeals that does and also to people to come up with solutions. And framing is very important because of this emotional reaction. And simple thing if you look about the loss aversion. So if you change arguing to look if you have a 10 percent chance or mortality to die compared to 19 percent to survive. Yes as soon as you start talking about the chance of death or something that you lose something people really quick are opposed to it. But gaining something a little bit less. Yes so there are different reasons why you would use different way to frame it. Now another piece of research of framing is gain framing or loss framing. I mentioned it already. So gain framing is where you highlight what you could get. Where loss framing is you highlight what you would loss because we note of the loss aversion people don't like to lose it. Getting things is yeah you need to do getting twice as many things then to compensate for the one thing you lose you could say. So and so gaining frame what we found in some papers indicate that you actually use it for example for prevention behavior. So for example use sunscreen lotions to prevent skin cancer. But so that might help you. But if you frame it what do you gain with this and because it's a long term perspective that you have to risk of skin cancer. So you might gain it like look you keep your health your skin healthy. So it's gaining something. Now the loss frame message framing is often used for when detection behavior is necessary. So if you have to do detection go in for if you have breath cancer. Yes then you lose frame. So you say all right if you without the sunscreen you might not guarantee that you live healthy. Or if you don't go in for the detection at the hospital your risk increases that we are not intervene on the right time. Yes. So if it is the lost is framed with detection so you are the chances that you lose something then the loss framing might help. If there you frame it as a gain frame that is something preventing for something the future to happen then you have to make it positive what is happening would be gaining in the now and here. Okay. So to summarize how you put the surrounding you the frame around your message really determine the kind of emotional reaction that you have. And in some cases it really helps if you consider framing it is a gain or as a loss. All right. I hope you enjoyed. See you in the next video.
