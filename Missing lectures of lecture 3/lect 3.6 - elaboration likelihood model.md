Summary of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) of Persuasion:

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) describes two distinct routes through which persuasion can occur: the central route and the peripheral route.

Central Route:
- Involves thoughtful and deliberate processing of the persuasive message.
- People need to be motivated and capable of processing the information for the central route to be taken.
- Persuasion through this route leads to lasting attitude and behavior changes because it is based on the content and quality of arguments.

Peripheral Route:
- Occurs when people lack motivation or the ability to process the message, resulting in minimal effort to scrutinize the argument.
- Persuasion is based on external cues or heuristics such as the attractiveness of the sender, the number of arguments, or the presentation rather than the message content itself.
- Changes in attitude or behavior from this route are usually short-term and less enduring.

It is important to note that a persuasive message may not always lead to central route processing, even with strong arguments, if the audience is not motivated. Similarly, an audience may begin with peripheral processing but shift to the central route if their attitudes have been changed even slightly.

In summary, for lasting change, targeting the central route is preferable. However, recognizing when people might process information through the peripheral route is crucial for effective persuasion; in such cases, incorporating relevant cues that serve as heuristics is beneficial.

The elaboration likelihood model. So in this video, we'll talk about the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion. And after this video, you should be able to explain this and particular different routes people can take when they are processing a message or to try to persuade them. So the elaboration likelihood model has an idea that you can process something in a kind of primary processing route, or it's a kind of peripheral. So if you get a message in, then the first question you can ask, and we've seen this before, are people motivated to look at the message? If they're not motivated, all right, they might, you could say, peripheral processing. Yes, or not that much effort they put in, and they might look at different things. So they might see who is sending this message, does the message look like, how many arguments are being made? Yes. So they're not really looking at the argument itself, but more at cues that could, as a guide, where they could use a heuristic quickly to see, all right, are they positive or not? And if they change based on this peripheral processing, this is not lasting. It might be just short term that they might slightly change their attitude or to do something. But most of the time, after a while, they're just gone. It's not a lasting behavior, but sometimes it could help. Because if you have this peripheral persuasion element, initially you don't have the attention. People take the peripheral route, but then it slightly shifts their attitude. And then if they get the next message, hmm, now their attitude might be more motivated to read this. So if we assume that happens, then we continue down the path, the question, are they capable of processing it? Are they not distracted, have other things to do, or it's too complex, don't have a background and knowledge about this? If not, then again, they would, they spray a full route. If not, then you can continue. And then people start to really consider what is the nature of the message. And here they can develop more favorable attitude towards the message, that's what you're saying makes sense, or maybe they might be less favorable about it. Now, if that happens, then they change their attitude, their beliefs. If they're not happening, you end up again that people haven't changed their attitude. But if this happens, then the question, it becomes more lasting. And that is what you happen if you have this central route of processing. So you have the central route and the peripheral route. So if you want to have lasting change, you try to target the central route. What's important here is that people often think that by giving lots of argumentations, people always go to the central route, but that might not be the case. If people are not motivated enough, they might not look at your arguments. They just look at if the picture is nice, who is sending this. Yes. So if people, you cannot expect them to be motivated in the first place, you might consider that they might process in a peripheral route and then you have to put in those cues. Because if you're, they're not motivated, they will never get to this point that they really start looking at your arguments. Yeah. So remember that when you're targeting and try to persuade people, can you really depend that they take the time and energy to go to the central processing route? If not, make sure and acknowledge that you have the peripheral route, that you put other elements in it that people use as heuristics to evaluate this information. Yeah. Yeah. So again, to summarize it, central route is thoughtful processing, lots of cognitive effort. People might not want to take that, but it is enduring and lasting. So it's very nice to have this, but people might not want to do this. And then you have the peripheral route and then people are associating things like what's in the cues and not really the content of the message, but kind of indicators that might help them to, all right, that seems like a nice person. A nice quote. This sounds fun. Yes. Okay. So that might be the thing, but it's not lasting. So that is the summary. Central route of persuasion and peripheral routes. Lasting change, less enduring change, much effort to do, fewer effort to do. Look at the content, thoughtful processing, or just looking at the surface to certain cues. Okay. See you in the next video.
