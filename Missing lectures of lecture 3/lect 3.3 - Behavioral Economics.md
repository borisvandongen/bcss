Summary of Six Principles of Behavioral Economics:

1. Best Feasible Option:
   - Traditional economics views people as rational, aiming to maximize gain and optimize resource use.
   - In reality, habits, cognitive biases, or indifference may prevent people from making the most rational or optimal decisions.

2. Reference Point:
   - Decisions are not made in isolation but are compared against a reference point, which can significantly influence perceived value and choices.
   - Changing the reference point shifts what people consider good or bad.

3. Loss Aversion:
   - People are more sensitive to losses than to equivalent gains; losing one euro feels worse than gaining one euro.
   - To compensate for a loss, a person might require a gain of double the value.

4. Endowment Effect (also known as IKEA effect):
   - Ownership and personal effort in creating an item can lead to an individual valuing it more highly.
   - People may demand more money for items they've personally crafted compared to equivalent items acquired from others.

5. Self-Control:
   - It can be hard for individuals to prioritize long-term gains over immediate gratification.
   - People often choose short-term pleasures (like unhealthy snacks) despite their long-term preferences for healthier options.

6. Social Preferences:
   - Decisions are influenced by comparisons with what others receive or experience.
   - Concepts like negative reciprocity and behindness aversion show how people dislike being worse off than others.
   - Social dynamics can influence financial markets; widespread biases can lead to market bubbles.

Additional Concept - Nudging:
   - Instead of limiting choices, nudging makes a preferable option stand out, encouraging better choices without restricting freedom.

In summary, while classical economics assumes rational behavior, behavioral economics acknowledges that various psychological factors shape actual human decision-making processes. Understanding these principles helps in predicting and influencing economic behaviors, both in individual contexts and market-wide scenarios. The upcoming video will explore 'nudging' in more detail.

Behavioral economics. In this video I will show you six principles of behavioral economics to give you an idea what people are doing when they speaking that they use behavioral economics. And for this I use a paper with some bright space which talks about these six principles. Okay now let's have a look at them. So the first principle is the best feasible option. So in economics rational economics they consider people as rational beings, try to optimize the resources and the use of their resources and to have maximal gain. However people are not always capable of coming up with the best rational solutions. So although we consider people rational agents because of their habits or their biases, cognitive bias they may have, or lack of interest to figure out what the best option is, they might not always act in an optimal way. So that is important to consider when you think about humans and what kind of decisions that we make. Reference point. That's an important principle is that people are not only taking decision in isolation, they compare it with reference points. So if you change the reference point they might also take another decision. Now so for example if you consider all right I run 20 kilometers. Is it good or bad or something? It depends for example if the reference point you have. If you set yourself that you want to run 50 kilometers, 20 is not that good you might think. But if you set yourself a target like 5 kilometers it sounds all great. So it depends how you compare it with. Now what happens also with reference point is loss aversion. So people don't like to lose things. Even if the same amount of money you get or lose, this losing seems to be much tougher sometimes twice as tougher than getting. So getting one euro or losing one euro is not the same euro in a sense. So the lost has to compensate for loss you actually have to gain two euro in the sense. Yes so that's weird but that's how people look at things. Endowment effect another kind of thing. So you might own a table but if you have made the table I mean you still own it but the point that you made it makes it much more worth for you. Yes so rationally it should be no the table is like 100 euro. Who created it if you got it from someone else the table is 100 euro but that's not how people see things. If they had put a lot of effort in it to create this thing that's it's now become theirs and then you see they will ask more for this table. Now that's the endowment or I Ikea effect they sometimes refer to. Self-control. Now people have problems with self-control. If you're rational you would look at a long-term gain but that's not always what happens. People often look at the intermediate gain or the gain they get very close now in the now instead of in the future. So looking at snacks for example if you ask people would you add healthy food yes in the future they will always say they will do it but if you ask them now what do you want to eat then they might still go for the nice less healthy stuff yes. So think about it. It's difficult for people to self-control in the now and here. Social preferences. So again if something happens we also compare it with other people how they are doing it. So we're not compare looking at it on its own but think about all right what did the other get or what did the other did not get. Yeah so for example the negative re how does it give a word but I can do it reciprocity almost there so normally if you get something or get something you will return this kind of similar thing so it's tick for tack. Now negative means that you're not playing that game and in the sense is when a nice example is if you know that your neighbor is selling the car and the car is quite new and everything then you normally would say all right I have to buy the car I give you a nice amount of money for it but if I know a little bit more about it so now I have a social idea about it that my neighbor is moving to the US and desperately need to sell the car because at least tomorrow then I can give less way less money and then the value of the car so I now take in the constraints that my neighbor is having. A behindness aversion is another one so people don't like it to be behind another person so the picture is this if you give a person an ice cream they're happy thank you get an ice cream but if you see that the other person get two ice creams you're upset why is the other getting two ice creams yes now that people also don't like that now of course other kind of social pressures exist that can influence people now that is one of the six principles. Now economics is often about a market exchange and also at the market financial markets or stock exchange whatever there are social factors playing but sometimes less so it depends and it depends what you could see is if only a very group might be acting irrational on biases it doesn't have a huge impact but if a whole market all the sellers and buyers have this bias then of course it could influence the whole market so think about the dot bubble come or the US house bubble then everyone had this bias about prices and the value of things and then you see this whole psychological effect affecting the whole market and also important important principle is nudging we will talk about it much later in a whole video about it but it's also an behavioral economic principle an idea that the theory is you could say in theory I limit people's number of options they have and by limit it I could force people to choose the right thing but people don't like to be limited yes so what we will be talking about in nudging is to keep it open all the options but make one more preferable that people would take it that is nudging okay so we went to six principles and the best feasible option might not always picked users or people because of all kinds of psychological constraints reference points people when they make a decision look at the reference point for that decision self control very difficult for some people in the here and now to control themselves sometimes social preferences and your decision or what happens you compare it with other people the market exchange we talked about is that the market change psychological biases might also influence the whole market in certain situations and nudging yes you don't like to limit options often but try to make the preferred option more preferable okay so that were the six principle of behavior economics see you next video
