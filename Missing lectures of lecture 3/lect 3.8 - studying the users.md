In this lecture, we delve into studying and defining the user for product design and development, focusing on the 'E' step of Wendell's DECIDE model, which stands for Exploring the Context. The main points covered include:

1. Defining the User: It is crucial to establish a clear picture of who the target audience is. Misalignment within a team regarding the target user group may lead to ineffective product design. Dialogue with the marketing division can provide important information, such as age, gender, and demographic details.

2. Understanding the User: Going beyond demographics, understanding a user's motivations, past experiences with similar products, and their relationship with existing products or the organization is vital. Prior experiences and relationships inform how users might interact with a new system.

3. User Research Techniques: Various techniques such as questionnaires, focus groups, and interviews can be utilized to collect user data. While not covered in this course, other courses like Social Cognitive Engineering and Data Science Methodology offer insights into these research strategies.

4. Defining User Interactions: Analyzing how users interact with existing systems can reveal preferences that inform new product designs. Understanding why users engage with certain applications helps in tailoring the new system to match their motivations and needs.

5. Persona Development: Creating personas can help a team visualize the target user, facilitating focused design strategies. Personas are archetypal users embodied in a detailed narrative or descriptive listing that includes their background, concerns, and motivation. They assist in evaluating design decisions by considering what a specific persona would prefer or reject.

6. Handling Diverse Populations: Design may need to address different user needs, which can be achieved through adaptability (where the system changes in response to user preferences, potentially utilizing AI) and user adaptations (where users customize their own experience). Alternatively, creating different versions of the application for distinct user groups is possible but may be costly.

In conclusion, properly defining and understanding your users is a key aspect of product development that affects design choices and user experience (UX). Employing user research techniques, defining user interactions, creating personas, and considering adaptability and diverse user populations can lead to more effective and user-centered product design.

## Transcript

Studying the user. In this video I will explain how you could study the user or at least define the user that you are and describe the user that you are targeting. Yes? So if we look at Wendell, his DECIDE strategy model, however you want to call it, we are now at E on DECIDE and it is chapter 7, exploring the context. So, first of all, who is or are the users you are working for, trying to target? Now, that is something you have to define, because if one person in your team thinks you are doing it for young people from 12 to 15 and the other person thinks that you are targeting someone old, from 60 to 70, yeah, then you really have a mismatch. Now, how do you know your user group? Often you can ask in an organization the marketing division to give you information about age, gender, demographic location, the number of people, have they mobile phone use, all these kind of things. So try to talk to them, get as many information about your target group, so you know a bit which people you are focusing. Then you have to collect information about them, that helps you to understand them better. Once you have defined the characteristics, now it becomes important to think about what they do and how they think, because that helps you when you try to motivate them later. So, what is helpful there, for example, what kind of prior experience they had, what kind of actions did they do before? So, maybe they were already jogging or walking, if you want to set them up to a marathon, then you can build from this, so you need to know. Also important, the kind of products they are already using, so what kind of applications, because maybe then you have an idea, alright, they are using many already tracking devices, they are used to that, so maybe I can build on this idea of tracking, but then give advice on this tracking. So, be aware of what people's prior experience is with other systems applications. Also, think about a relationship these users might have with your company or your organization, because you might want to build on that or keep in line with that. Also, try to figure out your users' motivations they might have of doing this action, or try to achieve your outcome. Why do they want to lose weight? Why do they want to run a marathon? If you know this, then you can use that in your strategies to motivate them, yes? Also, know the things like the relationship they have, the physical activities they are doing, the psychological state they have, their economic status, so how much money do they have to spend on doing this, or do they have a very busy lifestyle, do they have to do other things? Be aware of this, yes? So, to do this you can, for example, think about questionnaire, focus group, interviews, all these kinds of activities to collect this data. Now, in this course we will not look at that. Other courses in our program are offering this. So, for example, Social Cognitive Engineering, Professor Nierings is looking at this, but also another course if you really want to analyze data, which you collect in these surveys, then you should think about the seminar of research, the methodology of data science, but not in this course. Then, you should also think about in what way should they like to interact with your system? This is difficult to answer, of course, so there you can look at how do they do it already with other applications. Again, what is their prior experience with this application, other products, what kind of relationship do they have with these organizations that provide these applications, and why are they using these applications? Again, try to understand what they actually do and their thinking, why they are doing this. Now, to give you a bit of an idea, we in the past did some research in trying to develop an application that helped people with sleeping problems. Where we initially started there was to figure out what applications are out there actually. What is the niche in the market, you could say, of where people are not actually being supported that much yet. So here you see an overview where you see different kinds of channels, mediums, so is it a physical product, is it a website, or is it an app, and then what are they trying to achieve, what goals? Is it helping to fall asleep, or just to wake up, so think an alarm clock, or is it a sleep tracker that you have an idea to monitoring how well you slept during the night, or is it a whole sleeping coach application? Now, you see here an overview where we found all kinds of applications already being active, and you see that there are very few if you think about the website there, or an app with a sleep coaching. Now, that's what we actually were targeting in our research, but it also gave us an idea to look at past behavior, or how people already experience. So what we did, we're asking people from these different groups you see here, so had used the app for falling in sleep, or use a physical product to do sleep tracking. So that's what we did, we invited them in focus group, people who are already using other applications in this area, and asked them their experience. So what we learned is the reason why they are using this. For example, to overcome their sleep problems, or they're just interested in the products. What happens if they are more therapeutic related? What were their concerns? Maybe they found no effect when they were using it. So how did these people use them as alarms, and was it okay to wake them up? Now, this kind of information we learned with talking to these people, and that's good because you can learn already from how successful or not successful other products are. And then you can learn to do it better in a sense, or see what the motivations are, or what the problems are. So use of motivation. It could be that they pick up those therapy products because of their personal attitude, because they like this thing. And the consumer things were more functional, that they wanted to have an alarm clock to wake them up. So there are different kinds of reasons and motivations why people would want this kind of product, and more therapy related, like the coaching thing, or more functional. Another way what we learned there in this project, asking people who have sleeping problems now, or are sleep experts, or coaching experts, so we gather them in focus groups and also start talking with them. And here we learned, for example, how important it is that they feel in control. So if they feel that they're in control when they have sleeping problems, and they can address them and it's not just someone tells you to do this, A, B, C, D. Then they're more motivated to do this, and to make a commitment. So control was an important thing they mentioned. Also what they mentioned, they want to do it for their own sake. That's their main motivation. Intrinsic, they were telling us. Not that we always have to believe that it's the only thing, but it is what they tell us. So that's important. So in this focus group, listen to people and also try to understand why they are saying this. And not always think, all right, that's what they say. They are really motivated and can always do this, because you will learn it's not that easy. But it's important that if you start communicating in the beginning, that you align with this idea that, all right, we're going to help you and achieve and give you possibilities because you want to be in control. And it helps you to get through this whole thing. We also had a whole discussion about if you download the app, can you then assume that people will then do the whole therapy, you could say. And we saw with law of attrition, that's not going to happen. Lots of people just download it just to explore and learn a bit. Then what were their thoughts about this adhering enhancing strategies? So we can use all kinds of persuasive strategies. Would they like this? Now, mixed opinions. Coming down to, look, they thought they were adults and they should not be treated like children that someone else is telling them what to do. So that's important. That's how they perceive this thing. So we then consider we might not start with this kind of points and award systems, but later introduce a bit more fun if they get it. But not as a starting point, like this is how we will make you do things. Now from this focus group at Hauser tells us a bit about the motivation, why people do these things and what they found important. Now, this helps you to do these kinds of things to get this information. Now, once you have this information what often helps is to create personas. So personas helps you to visualize actually as a team, the user. So who are you making it for? Because the market department gave you averages like the average age is 25. They on average have an income of something. Yes, but it's very difficult all those graphs to think. So a persona visualized it. It's an archetype. It's not a real person. You just create this person, but it stands in for a real person. And it helps them, the whole team, to focus. We make three personas and we have Bob we make it for, Susan and Alice. And they have different kind of motivation, different problems. But then you could ask yourself, would Bob like to do this? Or would Alice try to hang in when it becomes difficult? Yes? To build the personas, you write a piece of text with all kinds of information like their motivation, their background, their worries and these kind of things. And that helps you each time to go back to, if you have a question would Bob do something? Because Bob hates actually eating healthy. Bob is in it for the fun of life. Yes? Yes, so this helps you to evaluate for yourself. But you can put all kinds of things. Where are the constraints Bob might have? Maybe legal issues that Bob has to consider and also their prior experience. Now, here's an example I took from the web about the persona and let's read it then we go to it. So it's really good to have this really story to help you in the case when you have big discussions in your team. So let's go to this long one. Bob is a 50 year old and works as a mechanic within an organization offering road service to customers when their car breaks down. He has worked in the job for the past 12 years and knows it well. Many of the young mechanics ask Bob for advice when they meet up in the depot and he always knows the answer to tricky mechanical problems. Bob likes sharing his knowledge with the young guys as it makes him feel valued part of the team. Bob works rolling days and night shifts and spends his shifts attending breakdowns and lockouts. About 20% of the jobs he attends are complex and occasionally needs to refer to the standard issue manual. Bob tries to avoid using the manual in front of customers as he thinks it gives the impression he doesn't know what he is doing. Bob has seen many changes over the years when the company and he tries his best to move with the time. However, he found it a bit daunting when new computers were installed in his van several years ago and now he has heard rumours that the computer is going to be upgraded to one with a bigger screen. That means to be faster and better. Bob has been told that he will be able to access the internet on the new computer. He has heard about the internet and saw it once in an early version on his manager computer. He wonders if he will be able to find out what is going on in the companies more easily, especially as customers seem to know more about the latest companies news than he does when he turns up at the job. This can be embarrassing and he has sources of frustration for Bob throughout his time with the company. Bob wonders if he will be able to cope with the new computer system. He doesn't mind asking his grandchildren for help when he wants to send an email to his brother overseas. But asking the guys that work for help is another story. In this story you see a lot of things that are going on with Bob, what his interests are, also the things he worries about. This helps you to understand what you are making for someone and what could stop them or motivate them. Another type of personas are just more than lists. Here is an example. We made once another project for sociophobic patients. They have anxiety to speak in public or talk to other people. They have a name, Marijn, nationality, Dutch, male, 6 years old, average, computer scale, hardware, PC with a large screen. I don't like this if I look at this because it is just a list. It doesn't really give you an idea and feel who Marijn is. This might be the starting point but then try to write it into a story. Then three important things you also have to think about. Handling diverse populations. So you have the different personas but you can also think about these are different people. How can I make one application that can serve all those different people. Then you have adaptability and maybe considering multiple versions. Adaptability is that the system can change itself and adapt itself to a specific user. So this is often quite complex to do. Here you often see that you start using artificial intelligence because then the system starts learning about the user and starting adapting itself. Now for the user it is in a sense nice. He doesn't have to do much. The system is doing all the work. Risk that you have. If your algorithm gets wrong, then you basically work against the user. So great if you can do it right. Good for the user in the sense that he doesn't have to do much. If you get it wrong the risks are high. Adaptability is often forgotten that we can also do it. We can ask the user, look do you want the system to respond this way or that way. So the user chooses. So then he can or she can adapt the system to his wishes. So now we have to ask the user a little bit more because they make half the decision. So maybe once or twice is fun but you're going to ask it every day. Maybe that's too much. The other hand it's highly likely that you do it the right way because the user indicates that he wants it or she wants it like this. The matching is often much better. And it gives also the user the sense that they are in control because they make decisions instead of the system does it for them. Now another strategy is to make completely different versions of the applications. So then you have different applications for the users you could say. So for this might be for positioning or targeting very young people older people. This might be for advanced computer users lesser advanced. Now that's also a good strategy. The downside is you have to keep all those versions up in the air. So it's quite costly often. So in this video we looked at the user how we collect data about it get more information and also to represent the user in personas to ourselves so that we can understand
