### Summary: Social Judgment Theory

Social judgment theory explores how people process persuasive messages and how such messages influence their attitudes on a given topic. It proposes that individuals have a scale of opinion, ranging from favorable to unfavorable, with an anchor point that indicates their current stance on an issue.

#### Key Concepts:

1. **Anchor Point**: This is the individual's current position or belief on a topic, such as the death penalty. It serves as the reference from which other messages are evaluated.

2. **Latitude of Acceptance**: If a persuasive message is close to the person's anchor point, it falls within this region. Messages in this latitude are generally seen as reasonable and are more likely to be accepted.

3. **Latitude of Rejection**: Messages falling significantly far from the anchor point reside within this region. They are likely to be strongly opposed and outright rejected by the individual.

4. **Latitude of Non-Commitment**: This is the middle ground between the latitudes of acceptance and rejection. Messages that fall here are not strongly opposed nor strongly accepted, allowing the individual some room for persuasion.

5. **Ego-Involvement**: The theory suggests that higher involvement with an issue can lead to a larger latitude of rejection, as individuals develop stronger views. This, in turn, shrinks the latitude of non-commitment and makes attitude change more challenging.

6. **Persuasion Over Time**: To effectively change someone's attitude, initial messages should target the latitude of non-commitment. Subsequent messages can slowly shift the person's anchor point, gradually moving them from a position of neutrality to one of acceptance or rejection.

7. **Boomerang Effect**: If a message is too extreme and falls within the latitude of rejection, it may lead to the boomerang effect, pushing the individual further away from the advocated position rather than persuading them.

#### Application of Theory:

When attempting to persuade, it's important to consider the listener's latitudes and to deliver messages that are not too far from their anchor point. Gradual persuasion through carefully crafted messages that reside in the latitude of non-commitment is more effective than pushing extreme viewpoints that may trigger a boomerang effect.

Understanding the social judgment theory helps in designing effective persuasive communication by aiming for the optimal point of potential attitude change: the latitude of non-commitment.

Social judgment theory. So in this video I'll explain you the social judgment theory and afterwards you should be able to explain to others the most important concepts and ideas behind the social judgment theory. Okay, so let's look at the social judgment theory. The idea is if I send you a message to persuade you, how would you process this message? The social judgment theory tries to split up on a scale where a kind of region. So imagine there's a scale from very positive to very negative. So, for example, what they always do in this is quite old research already, the death penalty. Are you in favor of the capital punishment or not? We are in America, this kind of research. So people might be very in favor of it or very against it. And somewhere on this scale is your anchor point. So where are you with your current attitude toward the death penalty? Now you get a message which might be the same or quite near your opinion, your anchor point, and this reason where you say, all right, that's quite similar, you call it the latitude of acceptance. So people might say, yeah, well, that's more or less my opinion on the death penalty. Okay, now imagine you get another message, which is more extreme. It's outside this range, what you would say your latitude in the eyes of the listener as what they were acceptable concerning their own anchor point. So if that is outside, you might have, let's do a very extreme, that's easier. So you get another message. So you're in the middle, I don't know, capital punishment, maybe for extreme cases, but not for everyone. Now you get a message, say, right, we have to be tough. Everyone who more or less violates is a criminal. We should, right, give a death sentence. Now that's extremely far away from your anchor point. Now this, you would say, all these extreme things are the latitude of rejection. This is the part that you say, these things, I will definitely, so far away from my part. Could also be the other side, yes? If you have said, all right, in some cases, death penalty could be, and you get a message like, no one ever should ever get a death penalty. Also not in a war situation, never. Okay. Now, on both sides, that might be that there's a latitude of rejection, which you not accept. Now, in between, there's also space. So in between the latitude of rejection and latitude of acceptance, there could be a latitude of non-commitment. So when people come in, you get the message again, which is a bit in between. It's not completely where your position is about the death penalty. It's not completely opposed, but you could. Now that is the latitude of non-commitment. And the idea is that people might be able to shift their, or reconsider, in a sense, this message coming in, if it is not yet in the realm of rejection. So if it is on the uttermost boundaries of, you could say, the latitude of non-commitment, that's the farthest you can get with a message. Now, another important thing, if you become more involved in the topic, so maybe you have no idea about death penalty yet, but if you get more and more information about it, then what happens is that the latitude of rejection becomes larger. You can have a better idea about what you are against, and what you really want. So the narrower you got, you could say, this kind of latitude of rejection becomes larger, non-commitment will be smaller, and maybe your position becomes clearer. So over time, with more equal involvement, people are more about the topic, there is less room to maneuver. Okay, now, to summarize. So you have an incoming message, it depends how it says, you have to think about the equal involvement. So if it is a topic that really people have a large understanding about, so then your rejection is smaller. If, on the other hand, this is something new, they might have a larger range of latitude of non-commitment. Now, there's one interesting thing, what you could do, and I've talked about it, is if you want to move an attitude. So I already said, you can move a person to this non-committal, but you could say, all right, the first message puts you a little bit here, then the next time you try to persuade people, you move them again a little bit, and a little bit and a little bit, yeah? So maybe the initial message is impossible to get people immediately to work, for example, against the death sentence, because they might find it extreme, and if it's extreme, too extreme, you get a boomerang effect sometimes even, they become, move the other side up. So if you really start sending messages which are in their latitude of rejection, that might be even worsening the thing if you're attempting to pull them this direction. So you might first try to push them to a position where they normally have non-committed about, and in your next kind of messages, you might, when they shift their anchor point a little bit, then you might be capable of pushing them to what initially they might see as a latitude of rejection. So it's slowly, slowly catching monkey, this kind of idea. So if you push too hard in the beginning, you might do little steps, and then you might have a bigger effect at the long run. Okay, so that was about this kind of social adjustment theory. Again, remember the latitude of exceptions you have, the latitude of non-committal, and the latitude of rejection. So think about it when you send a message where you might up, and you might want to optimize for this latitude of non-commitment. So there, people might still consider it. If you go too far, it comes back and hunts you as a boomerang effect and pushes in the opposite direction. Okay, I hope you enjoyed it.
