Summary of Protection Motivation Theory Lecture:

Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) explains factors that motivate individuals to engage in protective behaviors, particularly in health contexts such as smoking cessation. The theory posits that motivation to protect oneself is informed by two main appraisals: threat appraisal and coping appraisal.

**Definitions:**
- **Threat Appraisal:** This involves assessing the severity of the threat and one's vulnerability to it. Within threat appraisal are two components:
  - **Intrinsic Rewards:** Personal gratifications from engaging in the unhealthy behavior (e.g., pleasure from smoking).
  - **Extrinsic Rewards:** Social benefits or acceptance gained from the behavior (e.g., social belonging among smokers).
- **Coping Appraisal:** This involves evaluating one's ability to successfully take protective action (response efficacy) and weighing the costs or efforts required to engage in the healthful behavior.
  - **Response Efficacy:** Belief in the effectiveness of the adaptive (healthful) response to mitigate the threat.
  - **Self-Efficacy:** Belief in one's own ability to execute the adaptive response.
  - **Costs:** Consideration of the effort required to engage in the protective behavior.

Additionally, external factors may also influence the overall process.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Fear arousal is related to the perceived severity of the threat, not directly to motivation.
- PMT helps develop and evaluate effective persuasive communications and behavior change interventions by understanding individual reward perceptions and vulnerability awareness.
- Coping appraisal, particularly self-efficacy, is a strong predictor of motivation to engage in protective behaviors, and interventions should not only communicate the severity of the threat but also support individuals' belief in their ability to cope or manage the threat.
- Equipping individuals with coping strategies is crucial for increasing their motivation for behavior change.

In conclusion, PMT involves understanding the interplay between threat and coping appraisals to influence individuals' motivation to protect themselves. Emphasizing both the risks of maladaptive behaviors and the availability of effective coping strategies is vital for promoting healthful behavioral changes.

The protection motivation theory. In this video I'll explain you the protection motivation theory and you should be able afterwards also to explain it to others. Okay, so the protection motivation theory is about what are the factors that influence people to take, are motivated to do actions to prevent and to protect themselves, especially in health situations. The example we were all talking about, for example, is smoking. So protecting yourself from lung diseases, these kinds of things, how are you motivated to do it? Now, two big factors are influenced, it's the threat appraisal and the coping appraisal. So how severe do you think the threat is and how well are you capable of dealing with the threat? And that together motivates you to take those protective steps. If we look in more detail, and then you see that the threat appraisal is broken up by two, it's the reward that you get from the maladaptive response. So maladaptive is the unhealthy thing, you can say. So the smoking itself is there an intrinsic reward that you could say like, all right, I feel this sensation in my body each time I smoke. And the extrinsic reward is maybe your social surrounding, like you are one of the guys that are smoking, good, you belong, and it's adapted to your peer group. Now, these rewards are set against the severity of the vulnerability. So what are the chances that you get these lung diseases because of smoking? If they're quite extensive and you're aware of them, then the rewards become less and less. So that's the threat appraisal side. And fear arousal is linked not directly with the motivation in this model, but more with the severity. On the other hand, at the bottom, we have the coping appraisal. That's, again, the adaptive response. So the healthy or appropriate response given the circumstances, so that's the adaptive response. Now, so first you have the response efficacy and the self-efficacy. So do you feel capable and doing something about this to cope with the threat? And that is set, of course, against the cost. So how much effort will it take to quit the smoking? Can you really keep on doing this? Yes. So that, again, put together gives the coping appraisal. And then on the complete side, you have the external factors that influence the whole process that we also seen before in the other models. Now, it has been studied, this kind of model extensively, but what can we take from this? Now, what does this model help us to do? It helps us to understand how to develop and evaluate persuasive communication, or in our case, for example, develop behavior change support system. So we need to know how people see the rewards of smoking. Do they are aware that they are vulnerable? So this might be that we have to communicate to our behavior change support system. But also that we need to guide them on how to cope with it, because of the threat of the appraisal of coping appraisal. It can also help us this model to predict what happens. If you can predict, then you have an idea which kind of handles you have to change people's motivation. Now, I mentioned already, research is being done and meta-research is being done over the results of these studies. And what they see, there's a strong correlation about what the model already says. The threat appraisal and coping appraisal are good predictors of people's motivation to protect themselves. Then what we also see is that especially a coping appraisal variable is a good, strong predictor of people's motivations. So it's really important that people know they can cope with the threat. So this you help. So if you help people to become more capable of coping with a threat, they become more motivated to do these actions. Recent analysis shows that often if they develop these interventions, then people might in the event mainly often look specifically at the threat appraisal, so communicating very well the severity. And often they forget a bit about the coping appraisal variable, which we know from the other study is a very good predictor. So again, the moral of the story is make sure people are aware of the threats, but especially focus on helping people to cope with it. How can they go and quit smoking, for example, and not only telling them they can get these horrible lung diseases. Yes. So we have to balance it. And don't forget specifically, again, the self-efficacy. Are people capable, feel that they are capable of changing their behavior? If not, it's unlikely that they might actually change their behavior. All right, to summarize again. So in this model, you have the threat appraisal and the coping appraisal. Together they are influencing people's protection motivation. So their willingness to protect themselves. And they are influencing the threat appraisal again, is by the reward they get of the maladaptive response, the unhealthy response, set against the severity and the vulnerability that they might get these negative things. On the other side, the coping appraisal is the response efficacy. Are you capable of doing what is healthy or more adaptive response? And what are the costs for this? Okay. I hope you enjoyed it. See you in the next video.
