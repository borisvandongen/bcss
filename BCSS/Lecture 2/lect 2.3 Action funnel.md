Summary of "The Action Funnel" Lecture:

In this lecture, we learned about the five preconditions necessary for a user to take an action, as outlined in Wendell's Action Funnel. These preconditions can be used to analyze and overcome barriers present in product use or user engagement. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Cue:** Before an action can occur, there must be some form of cue or trigger, either environmental or internal, that initiates the desire to take an action.

2. **Initial Reaction:** This involves the immediate, often subconscious emotional evaluation of the action (System 1 thinking). The user must have a positive association with the action for it to proceed.

3. **Conscious Evaluation:** Moving to a more deliberate thought process (System 2 thinking), the user weighs the pros and cons of the action. The perceived benefits and drawbacks will influence their decision to act.

4. **Ability:** Even with a positive evaluation, the user must believe they have the capability to perform the action. This belief in one's own self-efficacy is crucial.

5. **Timing:** The action must be appropriately timed. If it's not the right moment, the user is likely to defer or abandon the action.

The Action Funnel metaphorically represents the diminishing number of users who make it through each stage of the process, similar to a marketing funnel. 

Key Points for Debugging and Product Evaluation:

- **Cue:** Ensure the cue for your product is clear and able to attract attention amid external distractions.
- **Initial Reaction:** Foster positive associations with the product or action to achieve a favorable initial reaction.
- **Conscious Evaluation:** Clearly communicate the benefits (pros) of the product and address any misconceptions about potential losses (cons).
- **Ability:** Make the action easy to perform to encourage user adoption.
- **Timing:** Propose actions to users at opportune moments when they are most likely to be receptive.

Remember that users may repeatedly go through the Action Funnel. Each time a user encounters a cue, they might be in a different emotional state or context, which can affect their journey through the funnel. The funnel should be seen as a looping mechanism rather than a one-time pathway. 

In conclusion, the Action Funnel can be utilized to systematically evaluate each aspect of a product that influences user action, allowing for targeted improvements and optimizations.

## Transcript

The action funnel. In this video I want you to consider or learn the five preconditions that before an action occurs. I want you to be able to answer the question what barriers should a product overcome to help a user take or do a certain action. Now for this we're going to use the action funnel that Wendell presents in his book. Okay, so the five preconditions are a cue is needed, a good initial reaction, a good positive evaluation. People should see that they have the ability to do it and they also consider that the timing is right for doing the action. Now let's look at them one by one. The cue. As we've seen in the hook model before in the previous video, we need a trigger to do something. And in this case Wendell refers to as the cue. Something in the environment or maybe internally should be there to trigger the action. If there is not such a cue it's very unlikely that people will do it. Reaction. This is system one again. So what is their emotional evaluation of doing this action? Is it positive? Do they have a good feel about it or not? Again, when we talked about the majo, these emotions and what kind of feeling are people associating with the product or the action that needs to be taken. Then we move to evaluation. Basically we move to system two where we have a conscience evaluation about the pros and cons to do something. The loss or the gains that I get of doing this. This of course should be the right balance. If not, people might not do it. Then the ability. Even if I am very positive about it, I might feel that I am unable to do it. Yes, so self-efficacy is again important. Do people feel or believe they can do it? If not, not going to happen. Timing. Is this the right moment? Should be another moment that people can do it. Can they postpone it or wait it? Yes, so it should be the right moment. Now this is what Wendell calls his action funnel. And there is a kind of a marketing idea that you start with a large population and you see after all kinds of stuff how many people would actually buy your product or you could say. And in our case would do the action. So the first large group of people will fall off if there is no cue. And the second if they have a negative reaction. And other parts of people would stop with the conscience evaluation. The last group basically if they still consider they don't have the ability or completely at the end or the bottom of the funnel if they don't see this is the right time for that. So we can use this funnel to debug. But we have to really consider that they don't go only once to the action funnel. Each time they have this proposition to do the action, they go to it. And then people might be in a new situation. I have an other emotional state which could again make them going to this action funnel considering different things. So it's not the one time you should think it as a loop going through it each time. Debugging as I mentioned before, we can use it. So think about your product, the cue. Is there a cue? Do people recognize it? Does it get enough attention? Or are there external things in the environment which basically overtake or draw people's attention away from your cue? That is the case. Something needs to be done. The initial reaction. Do people have a positive association with the action you ask in your product? Could be something the product maybe it associated with a brand which they don't like. Or it might be something that they don't trust or unfamiliar with something. Okay. Something needs to be done there. Conscience evaluation. Is it clear what the pros are for a user? And don't they have the wrong ideas about the lost? And the pros and cons should be clear to the people. And then also favorably to what you see as the balance that they gain out of this kind of things. The ability. Is it easy for a person? If it's very difficult to do the action, yes, it's very unlikely they will do it. And is there enough urgency? Or change the round. Is the product asking the person at the right time to do it? Yes. If he's in the middle of a meeting and you propose let's do a running outside, it's not going to happen. So the system needs to be aware of what is the right moment to make this proposition. People sitting maybe in front of the television, nothing to do. Now, this might be the right moment to motivate them to do some bit of jogging outside. Now, to summarize, if you look at the action funnel again, so we have the cue, the reaction, the evaluation, the conscious part, the ability and the timing. And that we can use to evaluate a product. All right. See you in the next video.
