Summary of the Lecture on Decision Making, System 1 and System 2, and the Hook Model:

**System 1 and System 2:**
- System 1 and System 2 are terms coined by Daniel Kahneman to describe two modes of thought processing. System 1 is the automatic, quick, and effortless mode where we do things out of habit, such as walking or typing. System 2 refers to the conscious, effortful mode of thinking that is used for complex tasks such as problem-solving or planning.
- System 1 is like an elephant, powerful and capable of routine tasks without much conscious thought. System 2 is the elephant's rider, who intervenes when the situation deviates from the norm, requiring active and conscious decision-making.
- Using System 2 consumes energy, and since it's energy-intensive, people cannot maintain this mode of thinking for an extended period.

**The Hook Model:**
- The Hook Model is a framework used to understand how products can influence user behavior by creating habits.
- The Hook Model has four stages: Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment.
    - **Trigger:** It can be external (notifications, environment) or internal (emotions, thoughts) and prompts the user to initiate behavior.
    - **Action:** This is the behavior initiated by the trigger, which requires the user to have the motivation and ability (B-MAT equation: Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Trigger).
    - **Variable Reward:** Variable rewards ensure that the reinforcement is not always predictable, which is more stimulating and engaging due to the release of dopamine in the brain.
    - **Investment:** When users invest time, effort, or other resources into the product, they are less likely to abandon it, forming a cycle that encourages repeated engagement.

**Behavior Change Considerations:**
- Behavior change is challenging because people often operate using System 1, carrying out habitual actions without conscious thought. To break or form new habits, interventions must sometimes engage System 2.
- Emotions also play a significant role in decision-making as they can quickly activate appropriate responses or behaviors without rational thinking.
- Users may also be subject to cognitive biases, like anchoring or attention bias, which can affect their decision-making and behavior patterns.

**Using the Hook Model for Product Evaluation:**
- Products can be evaluated using the Hook Model by assessing:
    - Whether there is an effective trigger to prompt usage.
    - If actions are simple and provide clear rewards.
    - The nature and variability of rewards are engaging.
    - If there is an element of investment that makes users less likely to leave.

**Conclusion:**
- While System 2 is important for conscious decision-making, most behavioral patterns are governed by System 1's automatic routines.
- For creating or changing habits, utilising the Hook Model can be effective.
- The Hook Model helps in designing products that create user habits by ensuring a smooth transition through the trigger, action, reward and investment stages.

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to look at how we make decisions. So after this video, I hope that you are able to describe the difference between system 1 and system 2 and also can explain the hook model. Now, let's start with system 1 and 2. Kahneman wrote a very famous book about this and also got a Nobel Prize, so it should be good about the idea how the brain is operating and he says, in a sense, it's working on two levels, or he calls it two systems. So you could think about system 1 as a kind of an elephant and a driver whereby the elephant is system 1 and the driver is system 2. So system 1 is the powerful system. It can do things without much effort and it can do it very easily and very good in a sense. So these are the automated routines people have. Walking, bicycling, or just running or typing. These things we can do without much effort. And then, on top of that, you have system 2. This, in a sense, is the driver of the elephant. This is the thinking part, the things which take a lot of effort that people have to do. So if I have to start doing arithmetic, start planning a route or start thinking about how I can lose weight or consider what is healthy to eat, that's very energy consuming. But we can then reflect at the future. So what are the consequences? So this is a very interesting system we have as humans to do this. However, it's difficult to always work with system 2. Often we work with system 1 because it's working on routines and it takes less effort. And same as here with the elephant and the driver. If we are following a route which the elephant is familiar with system 1 in this case, then the driver doesn't have to pay attention. Yes, the elephant knows the way anyway. The driver, however, has to intervene at points where we deviate from the normal track. So now he has to activate and intervene and make sure that the elephant goes left or right where he normally goes right, for example. So there you have this active conscious aware process what you need to make that decision. So a lot of decisions we do unconsciously. We basically have learned to do this and how to do this. However, if we want to our new terrain, something new, then we really have to think with system 2 and start thinking. Or if we start deviating from what we normally would do. So if we normally take very unhealthy food and we want to change to something healthy, then system 2 has to be very active to make sure the elephant is eating healthy or in a sense you are eating healthy. Now there's a bit of a drawback as I mentioned already. It takes lots of energy to think and you cannot keep that up. So you can only be limited time that you can think and really look at other numbers. It takes more time, so you can only do it for once in a while. And most of the time you're running on automated pilot. And the automated pilot might allow you to do things that might not be healthy for you. So this you have to consider when you want to change people's behavior. The habits that people might have are operated by system 1. But if you consciously think that you want to change your habit, that's system 2. And system 1 and 2 are not always listening to each other. So consciously you might say I want to quit smoking. But your system 1 has a routine when he's bored or feels this craving, starts smoking again. And then system 2 really needs to be conscious and overriding. Or really try to fight system 1 when this craving gets so tough that you want to smoke. And you have to come up with strategies to do something about it that you get away or don't give in to this craving. Now, that is the system 1 and 2 you also have to consider when you change someone's behavior. Another way of looking at it also is, as DiMaggio thinks about it, is the influence of emotion. Often we think that we are rational humans, have rational ideas and we are governed by ration. But most of our things are also governed by emotion. And that's very important also. Because the emotion quickly puts in ourselves a kind of repertoire of actions when we, for example, are in danger. So if you look at the decision-making process put forward by DiMaggio, he says, look, there are two paths. You have A and B. A is a kind of the rational approach. We look at the facts, think about the decision that we have and come up with a strategy and make a kind of decision. Another pathway is B. B is your brain also takes in the environment and that pulls a certain emotion. And this emotion, the bodily senses you could say, also activates parts in your brain to think about this. So, for example, with the classic one, if you see a tiger, you don't start thinking, oh my God, I see something yellow moving closer, has some stripes, this seems like a big beast. No, you feel in your body that, all right, there's danger. And all of a sudden, parts of the routines are activated which help you to deal with the tiger. Run away or something or start fighting. You're not starting having routines like, all right, maybe I do some painting tonight, yes? So by this emotion, it quickly activates routines that are appropriate to deal with the emergent situation. Now, if you're more relaxed in the situation, then, of course, the rational part can be working. Now, this, again, you also have to consider when you try to convince people to change their behavior. At certain times, they might be much more governed by their emotion than what you rationally would expect people to do. Again, you see here the system one and two operating again. Also, if you look at the spectrum, as Randall put it forward, there are things that are very simple to think as an intervention to change and something which is very difficult. Yes, so if people are very familiar with it, it's a habit. They can do it very easily. Think where you have to follow general heuristics where you say, all right, every time I get up, I always start with, and that's a habit almost, doing the washing, brushing my teeth, eating. Routines or heuristics could always like, all right, try to keep things simple. Don't try to spend too much money on a day. When I spend money, let's use a couple of days to think if I can spend loads of money. These are heuristics people have. What is very unfamiliar things that people really have to think hard again. Again, you can see at the bottom, you have system two operating and at the top, system one. So the familiar things people use system one. In the middle, you have a bit of a gray area and the very unfamiliar things which needs intense thinking is system two. Things are much easier on the top, yes, with system one. So eating potatoes, chips out of a bag, it's a habit. It's not too easy, difficult for people, yes. Put the bag in front of them and quickly. If they don't pay attention, they shove it into their mouth. If, for example, it becomes a bit more difficult, it's picking out what favorite food from buffet. Yes, so now it's already a bit of assessment needed. So what is healthy? Now signing up for a diet workshop. Now you have to do a little bit more. Yes, so it's not anymore routine, but it's also difficult to get people doing it. Judging whether the cheeseburger is healthy or not. Now you really have to start assessing thing. Again, much more difficult for people to do. Then making a weekly planning of a healthy diet is a loads of things you're asking people to do, which is much difficult, more difficult to do for people, much more energy. Yes, so think about these kinds of activities and interventions you try to ask because you have a different level of fight which you're up against. Other things you also have to consider, specifically if you consider the heuristics people are using, so still more or less operating on system one, two, so in the middle, are these kinds of cognitive biases people might be having. Yes, because the heuristics are quick tricks to solve a problem, but there's a bias in these kinds of heuristics, of course. So anchoring. So people, for example, consider what's happening now to what they saw just before. So you might ask them first, come up, show one price of houses and then look at another set of houses. But because you first show that first houses, that's their anchor point. So they will compare their mind to the previous things they've seen. Yes, so that is one cognitive bias. Attention bias. Yes, some people focus their attention on certain things they are aware of or in a sense focus their attention on. Now, specifically, for example, if you have a phobia for public speaking, you would be looking at people specifically that look negatively at you. Take a whole audience and 100 people are happy about you. If there's one people looking, a person with this kind of anxiety would definitely have seen that person. Yes, so the bias of their attention. And other heuristics. So there are plenty of these heuristics. Availability heuristic is one. So people, the easy thing they come to mind, they think that is most likely also. So for example, the classical ones, if how you get killed, is it caused by your couch or a dog? Now people think, I could imagine that the dog is killing you. So they think, but falling off your couch and all these kinds of things happen more often. But it's not readily available in your mind to consider that as a couch or something that is dangerous. Yes, now these kinds of heuristics, you also have to consider when you develop something, especially if you're communicating with system two, the rational part of the human. Now let's move to system one and training or how can you change people here. Now there's lots of research there in the psychology field and specifically the classical one, behaviorism. And we'll come to that in the video when we start talking about learning. But here I already want to look and peek ahead. It's operant conditioning. Skinner became famous for that. It's a person does something and you give it a reward or punishment. And then you will see that they will more often do the thing you reward them for or do less the thing you punish them for. Now that's operant conditioning. Now people in the industry developing these applications also know this. And the famous model that they put forward is the Hooke model, which in a sense is behavioral conditioning. There are four steps in this thing that you have to consider. First I said, so this is the Hooke model. So you have the trigger, the action, the reward and the investment. Now let's start with the trigger in the Hooke model. So the Hooke model says you need a trigger for a person to start doing this behavior each time. So this could be an external trigger, a reminder. Let's, all right, today let's start running because you were supposed to jog. Yes, it tells a person to do something. And so this trigger could be also unpaid triggered. So it could be advertising that you see or it could be something the news is telling you and then they call it an unearned triggered because you as a company have earned this piece of attention that you can remind people to use your product. It could also be a relational trigger. A friend is telling you to do something like, oh, by the way, you should use this product or go to Amazon or to Bol to buy something or you should use the Fitbit or you should start walking around. So basically someone reminds you of that now. And a friend, of course, is a good person in a sense, close relationship to be used as this trigger. It helps you. An own trigger in this book they also consider is when the trigger is on the desktop or in the environment in the person. When he sees the icon, he think, oh yeah, I should do this. Or you get a reminder on your phone. So it's very close to you. It could also, instead of these external triggers, you have the internal triggers. So it's something that triggers in your mind. So I'm bored. Let's go to Facebook. Maybe I can see what my friends are doing. So you now have this internal trigger, which is connected to a kind of an emotion with let's do something, a certain thing. Now these could be internal triggers. All right. Then let's move on. The actions. So once you are triggered to do something, the whole idea is to do something. Now, whether a person does something depends on if they are motivated and have the ability to do it. Now, in Fock, he call his B-Math equation. So we will go to that in more detail later in another video. But quickly is if people are motivated, if they have the ability, then there is a trigger. If you combine that, it's likely that they will do the action. Now, the next step, once you've done the behavior, the idea is the reward. And it's not simply a reward. It's always the same. The best rewards are the things that are slightly different each time. Variable reward. Because if you look at the brain, the part that operates on the reward is the nucleus accomplices. Someday I can pronounce it. Which is part of the reward system. And it gives dopamine. Yes. And that is what we like, we humans. And the fun thing is, this thing is giving also dopamine specifically in unexpected reinforcements. So if you always give a person the same kind of reward, it becomes almost... Yeah, I can expect this. So there's nothing new on it. But there's a new element that really activates these dopamine systems. What also interestingly studies found is not actually giving always the reward, but it could also be the kind of anticipation that you get the reward. So in the action phase, if people start, all right, if I do this, I will get this or that, that anticipation already releases dopamine. Now, that is what sometimes also being used in these systems. Yeah. So make sure there is this reward. It's different each time or each time. Not always the same. That doesn't work. And also use this kind of anticipation. Oh, if I almost get this badge, then I get to a new level in my game. Yes. So now you're expecting something. I'm very curious what it will be. So this curiosity, ooh, that's really exciting. Then, and a very interesting thing, the hook model also show is the investment. Yes. If people have invested time in your product, they don't want to leave it because they spent time on it already. So think about it. If you think about LinkedIn, if you put your whole network there, you don't want to go to another product as LinkedIn because then you have to invest and get all your LinkedIn network again there. Or if you bought all kinds of iTunes songs or movies, if you then go to another platform, you would lose all your videos and music songs. Yes. So this investment also hooked people that they don't leave you. Yes. If they spent hours on your game and now have a certain status, would they give this up? Because if they go to another game, they have to also invest so many hours. So this investment in an application keeps people coming back and not to abandon to another product. And that is also something the hoop models clearly shows. Then the last thing often forgotten is the investment is also including loading up the next trigger. So make sure that there is a link to the next cycle that people see the trigger, do the action. Yes. So self-destructing messages, if you're not going to come back within five weeks, then you go lower on the scale of reputation in the game or something. Ooh, I have to come back. Or should I send you a reminder in a couple of days? Yes. Or next time if you feel low, come back to Facebook, see all your friends. Yes. So set up the next trigger. Now that is how you have the whole package in the hoop model. Now you can also use the hoop model to check your product. Yes. Now let's look at it. The trigger. Does your application has a trigger? If people really have to think about it. Oh God, what should I do today? Oh yeah, I should be running. Yeah, then it's unlikely that they will be doing it. Yes. Instead, if your application remind people, all right, today running at three o'clock, then you offload this element that people have to remind themselves from them. You offload this mental effort. The system will help people to do it. Now, if your system doesn't have a reminder or a trigger, an external trigger or an emotional trigger that connects with a certain emotion, like, oh, I'm bored or I have an urge or something, then it's very unlikely that people will start using your system and start also showing that action, the behavior. Then the reward or the action itself again. Is it simple and easy to do? If it is more difficult and people don't anticipate some wonderful reward, less likely that they will do it. The reward. Is it a variable reward? Again, is there a reward at least? And are people aware that there is a reward? Any investment. Does your product make it that people feel they have invested and don't want to abandon because they have put so much energy in it? And does it upload the next trigger already? So these are ways to evaluate your product with the hook model. Okay, so to summarize the video, we looked at system one and this one is where you operate automatically, the routines, and it's not much very voluntary action. It's just, again, the elephant is going ahead without you thinking as a driver where it should go, yes? It operates on a routine level, less energy, and it is a mode that often we use. System two is the part, the driver of the elephant again, where you consciously think about decisions and start to think about the consequences in the future and also try to think about what might be a good strategy. You can only do it limited of time and also not for a long period. Now, lots of people always focus in behavior change or system two, but don't forget, lots of problems is a system one where you have the habits. Now, one way to start developing a habit is how we show in the hook model, yes? You have a trigger, you need actions that are easy to do, variable rewards, and an investment. Okay, that does it for this video. I hope to see you in the next one. Bye.
