Lecture Summary:

**Topic**: System 1 and System 2, Hooke's Model, and the Action Funnel

1. **System 1 and System 2**:
   - **System 1**: This is the part of the brain responsible for routine and automatic processes. It is quick, requires less energy, and operates with little to no conscious control.
   - **System 2**: This is the more conscious, cognitive part that requires more energy to function. It is used for complex thinking and decision-making that demands attention.
   
2. **Hooke's Model**:
   - The Hooke model provides an understanding of how habits are formed and how to motivate people to repeatedly engage with your application by tapping into habitual behavior.

3. **Action Funnel** (Wendell's Concept):
   - The action funnel encompasses the steps or preconditions required before people take action as suggested by an application. These include:
     - Awareness: How users discover your system.
     - Consideration: How they think about the system.
     - Motivation: The drive users need to engage with the system.
   - These steps define the preconditions that significantly impact whether a person will perform an action within a system.

4. **Overcoming Preconditions**:
   - The lecture will conclude by exploring strategies to address these preconditions:
     - Assessing whether it's necessary to go through all phases.
     - Discussing "sneaky" or alternative methods to bypass certain phases.
     - Making the process smoother for users to engage with all phases.

## Transcript

So welcome to the second lecture and I want to give you a bit of an introduction about what we're going to talk about in the second lecture. In the second lecture we're going to look at system one and system two. So how is the brain working together? And some people have argued that there are kind of two systems going on. One is more for the routine automatic kind of processing the brain is doing and the other one is the more conscious, cognitive, more energy observing part. So we're going to look at that. Next what we're going to look at is the Hooke model. And the Hooke model tells you how you can create a kind of a habit and how you could motivate people to come back and continue using your application. Then we move on to what Wendell calls the action funnel. So what steps or preconditions are there before people do the things your application is suggesting people should do? So how do they first get an idea about your system? How do they think about it? Are they motivated for doing this? Now these are different steps or what you can call precondition before a person would likely actually do the action the system is considering to do. Let me close the lecture when I look into how you can deal with going to all those phases or meeting these preconditions. Do you always have to? Or are there sneaky ways around it? Or could you go and make it smoother to go to all the phases? Now that we will look in the last part of the lecture. So I hope you enjoy it and see you in the next video.
