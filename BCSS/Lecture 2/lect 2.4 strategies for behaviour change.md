Summary: Strategies for Behavior Change

In this lecture, we discussed three main strategies to facilitate behavior change in individuals, as outlined by Randall and his work. These strategies are designed to help a product or system guide people through the action funnel more effectively.

1. The Cheat Strategy:
- Consists of gaining consent once, turning it into the default action, allowing people to 'cheat' around the action funnel.
- Example: The shift from opt-in to opt-out organ donation in the Netherlands, which led to increased donations because the default behavior was changed so that all citizens were potential donors unless they opted out.

2. Habit Formation:
- Focuses on making or changing a habit, leveraging the automatic nature of System 1 (intuitive, automatic thought processes) and removing the need for System 2 (rational, conscious thought processes).
- Habit formation can be initiated by identifying a routine, setting a clear cue (e.g., placing a kettle on the desk), determining the routine (e.g., making tea), and establishing a reward (e.g., quenching thirst or feeling of accomplishment).
- Keys to habit formation include consistent cues, clear routines, monitoring behavior, rewarding the activity, and making sure there's repetition.
- To change existing habits, strategies include avoiding the cue, replacing the action with a healthier alternative, or using a support system like mindfulness to acknowledge the craving but choose not to act on it.

3. Support Conscious Action:
- Necessary when an action is rare and cannot be turned into a habit or 'cheated' (e.g., buying a house).
- Includes training and building support systems that aid with the learning process due to the greater effort required.
- This strategy embraces the full action funnel, offering guidance through the entire decision-making process.

In conclusion, the three strategies for guiding behavior change are cheat (consent once and go straight to default), habit formation (leveraging System 1 for routine actions), and supporting conscious actions (aided training for rare decisions). Each has different applications depending on the frequency and nature of the behavior we aim to change.

strategies for behavior change. In this video, I want to talk about three strategies that help people to go through the action funnel that we talked about in the previous video. I want you to be able to answer the question as what a product should do to help people to get through the action funnel. Now, let's see at the three strategies as Randall in his book suggests, which is a cheat, making or creating or changing a habit or support conscience action. Yes. Now let's start thinking about the cheat. The cheat is the idea that only consent is needed. So only one says I will do it and you don't have to consider anything else anymore. Making or changing a habit, then basically you work on system one, but you remove system two, uh, because you only have to think about, uh, take it once that you want to do it, and then it will become a routine. So you don't have the steps anymore about do I have the ability or do I evaluate it consciously? So you remove part of the funnel. If everything fails and you really have to go through the whole action, a funnel, because this action is done not often enough, then you might have to really support people with this, uh, conscience actions. Now let's start with the cheat. So the cheat is the idea that you actually ask people once, or you don't ask them, you make it a default. It's the thing everyone is doing. Yes. But only when you consciously saying I don't want to do it, you can step out of it. Now, what do I mean with it? Now think about, about opt in and out. So it used to be in the Netherlands about, uh, when you pass away, would you leave your organs for a donorship? In the past, in the Netherlands, you have to say, indicate, yes, I want that to happen. If you didn't say anything, then your organs would not be considered for a donorship. In other countries, um, the whole population in a sense, it was an opt out strategy. So the whole population is a potential, uh, would be offering their organs for a donorship only for those who didn't want to have to register that they didn't want that to happen. Now, if you look at the difference in the countries where you have this opt in and opt out, you see it, of course, a big difference between the amount of organ donorship being available. So in the Netherlands, we changed a couple of years ago also to an opt out situation because we had too few donor organs. Now here, the idea is to cheat. You basically don't have to make the decision. You don't even go to the funnel. Only when you want to oppose the action, then you have to start taking an initiative. Now, that is a way of avoiding. So a cheat around the action funnel. Now, another option is make it incidental. So only you have to think about it once, or you combine it with some other activity you're doing anyway. So, um, for example, in England, a lot of teenage pregnancies, and if you're pregnant, it is good for your baby that you add takes in folic acid. However, if you're not aware of that you're pregnant, what happens often with teenage pregnancies, they might take this too late. Now, one strategy to solve this is to add this ingredient in white bread, because white bread is something that teenagers might eat a lot. So you connect basically the behavior with some other thing that you want that they are already doing. So basically connected with something automatic. Now, another strategy where you see that is also happening is, for example, to get people to make Yahoo your favorite browser. Now, what you could do, you can link it, and that's what you do. If you install Java, for example, you might have seen this before. If you install Java and somewhere in the process is asking, should I make Yahoo your default browser, your browser, your search engine, so you connect to something else. And often people don't pay attention, and they say, yeah, yeah, yeah. And all of a sudden you have your search engine Yahoo. Yeah. So there you see, you connect it with another behavior or, and then you piggyback basically on that. Now, another strategy is to make it a part of a routine. So automatically, so people have to save money, for example, in their retirement. So make that the default for your pension, or you have to ask them once before you start your job, you would say, would you want to save, should we put part of your salary away for your pension plan? And people only once have to say, yeah, that's a good idea. And then for the rest, the remainder that you work at that company, you automatically save money. Yes. So you repeat, instead of asking each month when you get your salary, should I put this away? You only make once the decision and that is done for the rest of, I don't know how long it takes. Yeah. It's good also for sleeping. If you want to monitor yourself, you could register it in the morning. That's quite a work to do. Or you can have a watch, who does the registration for you? You buy the watch once, you install it, use it, and then it's done automatically. Now, these are the cheat strategy. So basically go once to the action funnel, or you just avoid the whole thing. Now, of course, it's not always possible, this strategy. Then the other strategy, especially if it is a thing in action that you want to do often, you can consider making it a habit because making a habit requires you not longer to think about it always. Because you once false the routine, system one is doing it. And then system two does not have to think about the evaluation ability and is it the right time? Now, take for example, me, I didn't want to do a bit more, be active. So taking more of the staircases is an activity. So I needed a cue. So once I saw, after lunch, I just looked sideways in the building. I saw the staircases, that was the cue. Oh yeah, I should take the staircases because I want to be a bit more active. Yeah. And then I do the reward. And when I up there, take all the staircases, I got the reward by, yes, I've done it again. I'm a bit more active. Yes, it could be very simple. Just being, having done it has to maybe be the reward. Now, Wendell also gave a nine steps how to build a habit. So the first step is identifying the routine that you have to do a lot of time. Now, for me, another example, I had to drink much more. So my idea was to put a kettle of tea water always on my desk that I could see it. So that was the cue. But first I had to identify the routine, drinking more tea. Then the reward, all right, the drinking of the tea, I feel satisfied and less thirsty. And I have done something which I want to do. That was my reward. Now I needed a clear cue. Now the clear cue was the kettle on my table. That was the clear cue that each time I saw the thing, I think, yeah, I have to drink more. So that was my cue. The routine, people need to know what they have to do. Now, for me, it was rather clear. All right, pour some tea, drink some tea. And then start developing this greatest cue. That's the next step. And then also monitoring if people actually doing it or try to remind them and see this and make sure there's this reward coming in. That's the next thing. And the last thing, of course, have this being repeated. And then you get this loop that we've seen with the hook model that once you have this trigger, you go ultimately to the whole routine if you have the reward. Okay, that is all about habit creation. But you can also need to sometimes to change existing habits and now become difficult. But again, we can use the steps, the five preconditions that we have to consider when we go to the action funnel. First strategy is if we want to get away from an existing habit is to avoid the cue. Yes, if the cue is not being there, it's not going to start happening, the action. Now you can see this sometimes at computers. So you have ad blockers who try to block you to see the ad because the ad is a cue to do something what you don't want. It could also be something the government, ah yes, you block your family, you could use this application to see certain parts of the internet because if they see things, they might start doing things with you decided with your family, your children should not do. But simply, for example, putting your WhatsApp on silence could already be a kind of avoiding the cue. If you normally have a ping and there's a WhatsApp and you start watching again, WhatsApp and you'd be distracted by reading it, just hiding it. Yes. So for example, I've learned that for my mail, if I just switch off my mail, because if it is active, my mail, I could see the number of emails being there unread. And that's for me already in cue. Oh, I have to read something. If I switched off my email application, I don't see this cue anymore. And I stopped the habit of each time with a common email in that I want to read it. Yes. So that is how you could break a part of the habit. Another step is to replace the existing habit. So the action itself. So hijack the reward and do something else. So you might have the cue, but then connect to something else. So I might have the cue, I'm hungry, need food. And you could say, but then connected with eating something unhealthy to eating something healthy. So you have the craving, but instead of you start eating crisps, you start replacing it with eating apples. So you start now replacing and hijacking the cue, but doing some other activities. Of course, it's a very strong habit that you want to counteract, like really like an addiction. Then you also need this conscience to have to do and really agree with changing this. Now, another way is using consciousness. Actually, you start to focus your attention on what you're doing to help people to change their habits. So just by being aware how much energy you use, how much water you use, by giving this information, people start changing their behavior. So you don't have to encourage them, just make them aware. How much money are you spending on this? How much water are you using? Just this kind of awareness help to change people's behavior. So we have the Pius effect, I think, or a Pius, I don't know even how you call the car, that they always take. So in this car, you could see, for example, how much energy you were using. And then people start, okay, become more aware and therefore start driving differently. And now more examples, of course, exist. An other way of using your mind in this is also what you consider mindfulness. So be aware that you have this craving, but don't act on it. So normally, in a sense, your system one is taking over. Yes, you have the craving, chips in your mouth. Yeah. But now what you could do is activate system two. You have the craving, and if you are aware, ah, I feel the craving again, let's not act on it. So you now intervene where normally system one takes over and would pick up the chip to start eating. You now are aware of it, and then intervene your hand going to the chips. You just say, no, leave it there, I don't do it. And what you often see with this craving over time, the craving goes away. Yeah. So that is a kind of conscious intervention. Now that is often what they say with mindfulness, what people are trying to do. So be aware of the cue, but don't act on the cue. Another strategy, what you can do with an existing habit is crowding it out with another habit. So imagine that you have built up a routine of sitting always in front of the television, doing nothing. And when you're sitting in front of the television, you have the urge to start eating. Now, do something else instead, plan to go outside, go to friends, go on the evenings, always do your sporting. So you don't sit in the couch anymore and have this urge to eat. You're involved in something else. So you don't even create this possibility that you've got this craving there. Yeah. So that is a way of crowding it out with a new behavior. Okay. So that was strategy two, where we try to develop a habit or change in current habit. Now, if that's not possible, imagine for situations where the event is only happening rarely. Yes. Then you might have to go to the whole action funnel and think about it, that you have to learn something for the first time, or that you have to, like buying a house. Yes. It's not that you do that every day. So then you have to do all the steps and think about how you can do this in a way that is good for you. Now here, often people start thinking about training, really sit down and consider how you should do that. Now here you can also build a support system, but then you really have to understand that this is a huge effort that you ask people to do. So this one is kind of what I will call it the last resort. If everything fails, then okay. Then you're asking people to make a huge investment and try to reduce this to make this training easy, understandable and to the point. But in some cases it's needed and then your system is helping them. Okay. Again, go to the action funnel. Okay. So to summarize those three strategies again, cheating only once the consent is needed, but then you, people can continue or it's default. So everyone has a, you can opt out. You can say, all right, I don't give my consent. So you have to be active then. Or if you recognize that this behavior is done multiple times, try to create a habit out of it. And only when it is one of the activity, but people really have to consider that, then start to think using your system to support this kind of training. Okay. That was it for this video. I see you in the next one. Bye.
