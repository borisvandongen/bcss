**Summary of Video Lecture on Preparing the User for Behavior Change**

In this lecture, we explored methods to prepare users for behavior change, including the use of self-narrative story editing, as detailed in chapter 10 of the course textbook.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Self-Narrative Story Editing:**
   - The self-narrative is the story we tell ourselves about who we are and influences our behavior.
   - Timothy Wilson's study showed that changing the narrative of first-year college students from "I'm a failure" to "I'm facing a challenge that I can overcome" improved performance and reduced dropout rates.
   - By reframing identity and rewriting the current situation, people can adopt new identities and behaviors.
   - Example: Encouraging individuals who see themselves as inactive to perceive their existing activities, like walking, as part of an active lifestyle to enhance their self-efficacy.

2. **Experience and Familiarity:**
   - Self-efficacy is driven by the experience of having accomplished something.
   - Familiarity with certain behaviors can be leveraged to encourage new behaviors by associating them with positive attributes.
   - Example: The "Superman" experiment in virtual reality demonstrated that the experience of embodying a superhero could lead participants to exhibit more altruistic behavior in real-world situations.
   
3. **Educating for Behavior Change:**
   - Education is important for explaining the 'why', 'how', and 'what' of behavior change.
   - Education should be timed appropriately, avoiding too early or information-heavy communication.
   - The educational material should be introduced incrementally to build skills and confidence, similar to progressive levels in games.
   - Education can involve psycho-education to understand the psychological aspects of behaviors.

**Strategies to Prepare Users:**

1. Encourage users to rewrite their self-narrative in a way that highlights their ability to succeed and overcome challenges.
2. Utilize familiar behaviors or positive associations to buttress the adoption of new behaviors.
3. Educate users about the reasons behind the behavior change, the process of change, and the specific actions required at the right time and pace.

**Important Considerations:**

- Be aware of the potential obstacles, such as the ineffectiveness of traditional education methods for habits, information overload, and premature training.
- Careful planning that involves backward engineering to determine when a user should learn certain behaviors or practices.

**Conclusion:**

In preparation for behavior change, one must consider the user's prior experiences, leverage self-narrative editing, associate new behaviors with positive or familiar experiences, and educate users effectively. Further details and strategies can be found in chapter 10 of the book.

## Transcript

Preparing the user. In this video, we're going to look at how you could prepare the user for the behavior change. And we will look at a couple of specific techniques and one of them for one which one we're going to look at is a story editing technique. And this part is explained in chapter 10, what you can look at is crafting the intervention and ability, the timing and the experience and we can look specifically at experience. So in the design model, we are in the crafting. So where in the previous video, we looked at the environment that you can design and analyze for support or obstacles for the behavior. In this video, we're going to look at the user themselves, what is it that we can do with the user to prepare them for the behavior change? Okay, now let's start with self-narrative story editing. And here an interesting story is presented by Timothy Wilson. So Wilson has this idea about people can write their own story life in a sense, self-narrative and story about themselves, and how we see ourselves influence the kind of actions that we take. The example that he gives is a little experiment that he did with first year college students who struggle in the first year. So what he did with one group of students, when they did, I assume the first quarter got some initial results, didn't go that well. He give them some information from students in the higher levels, which also struggled at that time, but show to them that they saw that as a kind of a transition that initially that worked, it didn't go well, but they then picked up and then used that struggle to improve themselves. And that in the end, they made it and really passed the first year. So by changing the story of, look, I'm a failure, it's not working in my first year, the first quarter, I'm already not passing all my courses. He changed this into a story to, look, I'm on the road to success. Now I have some hardship, but I can take the hardship to improve myself. And that's part of the learning process, that you see what is going wrong and then change your learning and the way you learn. By doing this, this group of students performed much better and a less dropout he found than when you didn't tell this story to students. So by creating or framing their own story, their self narrative, it helped this group of students to, in a sense, keep on going and to motivate them to, for this behavior that they changed, in this case, the study life. So self narrative or story editing is an important tool that helps people to see themselves in a different way than they would normally do. And for behavior change, that can be very useful because people might look at themselves in a certain way and then have a certain identity around that, which you want to change because of a new identity they want to have. The self narrative can help, in a sense, rewrite their current situation. Now, the example that I talked already before is walking. So people want to run the marathon or be more active. Let's don't do the marathon immediately, but be a bit more active. And they might say, look, I'm very passive. I don't do anything. So now you can rewrite a story. Say, look, you've been walking and sometimes you take the bicycle. Yes. So in a sense, you are already active. You are an active person because you're not always taking the car or the bus. If you go to places, you walk. Yes. So now you see, help people to see themselves in another perspective. Also see how they value actually important things. And these values might be connected with a new kind of person they want to become, kind of new identity and therefore also changing the way they see themselves. That is what a self-narrative can do. Let's see if I have another example. No, no example, but the important things I want to stress here is the self-experience. So we will come to that later in other videos, but self-efficacy is based on an experience that you have. And so you're comfortable of doing action is based on whether you think you're capable of doing this action. But if you think it's new, you have never done it. So the trick therefore is to use the self-narrative to write it in a way that you show that you have already done it, but maybe in another way. Again, back to this walking and running exercise by showing that you have, you are walking already. You have been cycling. You show that you have, in a sense, a bit of mastery of the experience. You show you're capable of that. Now that improved the self-efficacy. Now that is one trick with self-narrative. Now, some research has also been done about how people experience themselves, view themselves, can actually really change how they behave. Now, one interesting example was in virtual reality. People were two conditions, participants were split up and one, they would have an experience as Superman. They could fly. Where in the other condition, they were just flying in a helicopter. So they want to test if you give people this experience to be a superhero, would it also rub off if you ask them later on to do something? So in this experiment, they experienced whether they would be Superman flying or in a helicopter, they needed to go to a diabetic child that missed their insulin. So in a scenario to go quickly to deliver the insulin. And so this experience we have. So one was it just they flew with the helicopter. The other one, I'm Superman getting there. Then after the experiment, what the experiment did was they incidentally by accident top off a bottle with all kinds of pencils and that falls on the floor. And now they wanted to see who would actually be quicker and help earlier. So which of the two groups of participants would jump to the moment to help the person to pick up the pencils and help them. Now, of course, of course, for the moral service, the people in the superhero group would do that much more. There was the much often that they saw this behavior. Yes. Now, the explanation for this again is this kind of framing. They have a self story because they were thinking they were Superman. Yes, they could do these kinds of things. So by creating again this, activating this image about themselves, they might start also acting this way. Now, we have done something similar in our own research that had to do with people with post-traumatic stress disorder, where people might have in the past experienced a very traumatic event. So in our tool that we made was also to see that people that this event is one event and there are also other events in your life. So we try to make a kind of a life narrative. So to make sure that people were aware that there are all kinds of things in your life. And if you've been like a soldier being sent out to a war situation, that might only be a little part of your life. That might have a huge impact. But by putting in a larger perspective, people start seeing themselves as not only that person in that situation, in their traumatic event. Yes, again, we try to change the narrative of the person to see themselves in an other and a broader perspective. OK, another strategy how you can work on with people to prepare them for their behavior is to associate it with an already a behavior that is positive or familiar with them. Yes. So I mentioned that before already. So maybe they don't like the tooth brushing, but we've rephrase it as something like the fresh breath that you get. Yes. So you associate with something what they really like and it's more positive. Or the familiar. So the exercises you familiar them with walking. Yes. You see yourself walking and there's a bit of more walking. Yes. So they're familiar with it and associated with something positive. In computers, we also do this using this idea of make people use things they are familiar with. So if you look at the desktop metaphor, so on your computer, you see folders and you might have papers and things. So in a sense, you make use of the familiarity you are in the physical world with these objects. Now, think about it. If you have to ask people to do things, how could you describe it in another way what they're more familiar with and might be able to understand how to prepare for that. The last thing, how we also could prepare is educating people. Yes. So remember when we looked at the scale of thinking that is actually needed. So is it an automatic things or is it a habit? Or perhaps you can also have the very unfamiliar things people have to do. And if they're very unfamiliar with it, maybe you have to educate them. Okay. Now let's think about it. Educating. First of all, when would it not work? So educating, like telling people things, yes, isn't really working for habits. We do this with system one, because that is not a kind of a conscience. It's a routine. Yes. So tell people how to, first of all, bicycle. If you want to learn a bicycling, it's not something that I can tell you on a video. You have to experience and really feel it. So educating in a sense of a traditional format might not work. Another problem that might often help if you educate people is that they might be overloaded with the information. Yes. You want them to do this, this, this, and that you give them five minutes to learn everything. That is also not working. Another problem that might occur is you train them too early. So when they have to do, for example, the running, you already five weeks in advance, explain everything, explain everything, how you would do the last part of the finishing, which they only need five months from now. Yes. Yeah. So if it is too early, you give this information, they might not understand it, might not connect it and forget everything about it. Yeah. Okay. So these are quite common obstacles. So make sure you don't fall in these kinds of pitfalls. Education. Okay. So what can you focus on during education? The why, the how and what? Yes. Why? Sometimes you need to educate people why they should change their behavior, why it's important to do this. Yes. So think again about a trans-theoretical model that they might be still in the pre-contemplation or contemplation phase and they might still consider. So they even don't know whether they should do it. Is smoking bad for you? Should you do physical activity? Eating too much salt? Is that not good for you? Some people might not all be aware of these things. So here education could be more about the why. How is sometimes also important in education. So sometimes people need to know the process. What is happening to me? Yes. So for example, if you have an anxiety, you have to understand what the anxiety means, why that is there, what it makes you do and how to, what your reaction is there and what is kind of psychological principles. Now here often people get a psycho-education. Yes. But it could also be to explain people what is healthy eating. Yes. So that could also be part of the education. Then the what, especially are if you're in the preparation phase, you need to know what you have to do. So what are the actions and the skills that you need to do now? So that's another part of education that you can focus on. Now, when you consider education, you have to think about when you have to educate a person. So again, look at your plan and then do a backwards engineering thing. Yes. See like, all right, here they have to do the very tough thing. Then somehow before that steps, I have to explain that to a person. Yes. So identify which way, because then you need to know, all right, if here's something, then I have to teach them there. If there's here's something I have to do some teaching there. Yes. So backward engineering to the points where they need to learn something. And then try to figure out how you might schedule that kind of learning process. And what else? Also, think about whether you want to teach them once everything or start building. Yes. And that makes sense. You see that often in games that you have a simple level, an entrance level to build some skill, and then you go move to a next level where it's more advanced stuff. Now, this you also might consider an education. So you might want to run the marathon. But before that, you have to learn to run like for 10 minutes. Then you might have to first run for five minutes. Yes. So you build up the experience. You don't go immediately for the full thing. Yeah. So by doing this again, you create this mastery experience, the experience that you're capable of doing that and have a small success. Important. We talked about it already in the previous slides. Summary. Summary, what did we learn here? So we talked about in this video out preparing the user. Yes. Focus on their prior experience. How do we handle that? That they might already tried smoking and failed so many times. Did the exams and failed and want to drop out of college. So how do you deal with this experience before you change people's behavior? Now, the story editing is rewriting yourself. Narrative is one way of doing it. Associating the behavior with something you're familiar with already and have a positive thing about it. And you might also need to educate people. OK. In the book itself, in chapter 10, there's much more. I didn't want to touch this in this video. So but enjoy reading chapter 10 and see you in the next video.
