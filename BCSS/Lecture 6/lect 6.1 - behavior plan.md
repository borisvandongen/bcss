### Summary: Developing a Behavioral Plan Supported by Technology

In this lecture, we discussed creating behavioral plans that integrate technology, based on methods outlined in Wendell's book, particularly in Chapter 7, "Exploring the Context."

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Behavioral Change:** Understanding the preliminary steps leading up to the desired behavior change is crucial, as there can be many barriers to overcome.

2. **Obamacare Example:** An example given in Wendell's book highlights how Obama's team organized a grassroots campaign to support the Affordable Care Act by breaking down the actions required to call into a radio show and providing supportive tools to streamline the process.

**Steps for Developing Behavioral Plans:**

- **Initial Plan Without Technology:** Document the entire process and identify pain points, emotions, information requirements, and barriers to action.
- **Support With Technology:** Identify how technology can support the desired behavior, focusing on problematic areas or repetitive actions that could be automated or made easier.

**Behavioral Support Tool Example:** In the Obamacare campaign, tools provided step-by-step instructions, automated tasks like finding radio shows, and simplified reporting back to the campaign headquarters.

**Two-Phase Development:**

1. Define the behavior change without technology, identifying all the necessary actions and barriers.
2. Conceive technological support for the behavior, integrating solutions to overcome obstacles.

**Key Aspects to Consider:**

- Look beyond the system and consider the full behavioral process.
- Label each step in the process and identify potential issues.
- Differentiate between one-time actions and repetitive actions that could form habits.

**Mapping Techniques:**

- Similar to a **customer journey map**, display different phases, activities, moods, and touchpoints with the technology.
- Personalization of the map can help understand persona-specific challenges.

**Evaluating and Refining the Plan:**

- Verify the plan against personas to ensure realism.
- Remove unnecessary steps by focusing on the minimal viable actions.
- Look for opportunities to automate actions or simplify complex tasks.
- Recognize small wins for psychological encouragement.
- Consider cyclic behaviors and how to support forming habits.

The lecture stresses the importance of understanding the full context of behavior change and carefully integrating technological solutions to support and simplify the targeted behaviors, whilst considering persona's experiences, potential barriers, and emotional responses. Students are encouraged to apply these principles in their assignments, considering both the original behavioral steps and the addition of technology support.

## Transcript

The behavioural plan. In this video, we will look at how you develop a behavioural plan that is supported by technology. This part is described in Wendell's book in chapter 7, exploring the context. Now, think about it. If you want to start changing behaviour, want to do a bit of jogging and running, what does it mean before you can do this? So, before you can run, for example, you have to get the shoes, other clothes. You also have to identify which route you have to take. You also have to find time to do it, because you might have other appointments. And then remember to do it, actually. And also, you have to think about what you're eating beforehand. And more and more and more. So, it's important that when you're considering behavioural change, that you understand all the steps before that, that lead to the actual behaviour that you want to accomplish. And there are a lot of barriers there. So, to help a person, you have to really plan this whole behaviour, and then see what is going on, and then see to find solutions for it. Now, one interesting example Wendell gives in his book is about Obamacare. Obamacare, it's now already for a couple of years implemented in the US, but before it, it was not there. And so, he really had to get it to Congress and the Senate, and get a lot of support for it. Now, to get it, he needed his supporters to pressure, basically, Congress and Senate to vote in favour of it. And to do this, he wanted to set up a large campaign, which is a grassroots campaign to support people, to call their persons in Congress and in the Senate, to say, all right, you should do this. And also go on the radio, tell to everyone why it's important to have Obamacare. Now, to create this kind of movement, and to make them actually call those radio shows, they broke down the steps, what is actually needed. Now, the first step, a person has to find a quiet place. You not just call the radio in a noisy room. So, you have to find a place and a telephone. Then you have to figure out which radio show you're going to call. Next, you have to listen for a while to the radio programme, because you have to understand what the radio show is about, and figure out also the moment at a time to call. You need the number to call, and then work up the gums to actually call it. I mean, it's a bit scary to call the radio. Then call the programme actually, and then convince the person at the other end of the telephone line that you're not a weird person and a really normal person who can have an actually good conversation on the radio about this topic. Then, you have to say something intelligible and make some arguments in favour of Obamacare. And once this is completed, you have to report back to the headquarters of this grassroots initiative to tell that, all right, I've been already on that radio show, so someone else should target another radio show. Now, a lot of difficult steps, lots of things that go wrong. So here you see the behaviour without a support system. Now, what they did here was to develop a very simple tool to support people who want to make the call to the radio shows. So what they've done is, all right, first you give people instructions how to prepare so how they should call a radio show. So look for a quiet place. Think about your arguments. What are my arguments actually? How should I actually introduce myself if I talk to the first person, the screening person at the radio station? And also some tips and tricks how to behave. Some people might argue and oppose your view. What would you say? Stay calm, this kind of thing. So that's the first thing. So simple tips and instructions. But then what they did, you remember that people had to find the radio show, get the number and listen in. So they automated. So you could press a button, find a radio show for me with the telephone number already there. So that takes away the tasks you don't have to do anymore. Then when you call the radio show, you have your discussion. Then they also take the last step to make sure that it's very easy to get back to headquarters. Yes, you could in a form online, fill out. All right, I talked to this show and these are the things I learned. And that's collected then by headquarters and also then make sure that the next person who used the tool would select another radio show. Now here you could see how you have a behavior with several barriers is now supported by a behavior support tool to make it more likely that this behavior succeeds. Now, we're going to talk about a bit more in this video about these kinds of behavior plans. But before we go to look at a number of these examples, I want you to step back and think about how do we develop these things. So I think we should develop them in two steps. The first plan you make is without technology like we did in the case with Obamacare. So we first make a list of all the steps you normally should do. Then only in the second phase, you're going to look at how I can support it with technology. Because in the first part, where you write down the normal behavior, you can indicate where are the problems, what are the moods of people, the emotions attached to it, the information that they need. And now you see, all right, here's a problem. There's a problem. Okay, now I can think about what I can do with technology to support it. By doing this, you also have the whole package. Yes. When I was talking about running, yes, it's not only running what you have to do if you want to change baby. You also have the shoe buying, finding the time, all these things that might be outside sometimes the interaction what you do with a computer or the task itself. This also needs to be considered. Yes. So by having a whole overview, you make sure that you're not missing the important, the preconditions that has to be satisfied. Now, then if you start thinking about creating your behavior plan with technology, look at things, look at what are potential problems. So you can use the action funnel that we talked about in previous video and other lectures. Then you can also look for cycles, things that repeat. There is something here you can develop and have it. Think again about the hook model, how you can develop and have it. And what we also kind of look at are the problem spots and we call them the way where you could connect there with your technology, touch boards. We could talk to this later. In your assignment, I want you also to build this step or this plan in twice, two steps. So make sure it may be in the appendix that I see what your original steps were and also then the plan with support of technology. Now, Wendell has a couple of other suggestions when you build it. So think about what I mentioned, the whole process, the sequence of actions, not only about your product, your behavior support system. Often people only look very small what the system is doing, but the system is only a small part of the whole behavior plan. So make sure you have the whole thing. Okay. Label each step, yes? Give it names and also break it up in kind of rough phases you could see. So people have an idea, what I did is the first phase and then the next phase and this happening and the little steps in between. Show where the product is making interaction with the person and also indicate in the outside world what is happening. And again, see if you are missing steps and also indicate which are one-time steps because for those one-time steps, we might do something differently. Yes? Now, let's move on because making behavior plan is also being done in other domains, but then they call it something differently. So an obvious name for this is the customer journey map where people make products to sell things and in this environment, they call it the customer journey map. So here's an example where you get the awareness, consideration, the purchase, the retention and advocacy. So you have seen here, you have those different phases being labeled, which gives you an idea. All right, what's going on? And during these phases, you see all kinds of activities needed. Now, similar, we can do that for a behavior that we want to change. And I mentioned already touch points. So these are the things when you have the normal behavior and the point where the technology connects to each other, the touch point. These are very important to identify because that gives us an idea what kind of interface and what we are actually supporting. Also good to notice is the over the journey that we make indicate the emotion of the person. Is it uplifting or down? Because that is also indication when they need support, yes? So you'll see that in the examples that you see sometimes smileys or a kind of a bar going up or down indicate where the people are high in spirit or low in spirit. And in the low points, there needs to be something there because that could be a critical barrier why people might drop out. Okay, also try to personalize the map. Put also little stories of different personas or uses that you remind yourself what could happening at those low points or those touch points. Then you understand again what the importance are in those different situations because you have to develop for that. All right, let's start looking at some examples. So the first example is the kidney transplant experience map. So here you see a patient journey has in the domain they call it a patient journey for people who need a kidney transplant. And there you see the big on the top of this map, the big faces, kidney failure waiting to get on the list. So people, the kidney is failing. So that is very beforehand. Then you have the surgery and then you become an inpatient in the hospital and then you go out of the hospital the aftercare. And then you can see what the caregivers are involved. So they're doing the face of different people. So you have nurses, maybe your GP is involved. Now, different things. Then also the milestones, what is happening? So in the surgery is an important milestone becoming the first visit that you make. Now, these kinds of things important to understand. And there's, you see the touch point. You see, I've told you about it's going up and down seeing also the interaction with the system and also the mood. You see, all right, you hear, for example, the first time that you might need kidney transplant then the waiting list, the waiting might be very difficult. Now, here you see how did this thing and below it, you see stories of actual patients explaining what it was for them to go through this journey. Now, this helps you of course to understand what is happening. All right, let's look at another example. So the cancer experience map. So we stay for a moment again in the health domain. And here also the big faces. You see here the diagnosis, treatment decision, active treatment, the end of active treatment, after the treatment and recurrence. Yeah, so, and here you see also different elements being placed and explained. I cannot actually see it from this point, but the whole idea is that you break it up over the faces. You look at different elements that you want to see like the emotions, the story, the barriers and the touch point. Okay, now take another example. Here is the customer experience map with very detailed explanations about what is happening. Yeah, you see a lot of scribbles and information. That is interesting. Do this also for yourself. Don't just a little line and that's it. Use this map, behavior map to explain things, what happens in what situation. And again, at the bottom, you see this emotion going up and down and also where service or the computer system is interacting. Internet banking apply here for people who apply for internet banking. You see the user journey and the emotion map. Yes, also banks are doing this. They want to understand their customers. When would they buy something? What is the low? What is the risk? Because if the emotion go, they might drop out and not, for example, start using internet banking. Yeah, so they also make these steps. And at the bottom here, that's interesting. They set the goals. And what do we try to achieve in each of these phases? What? Okay. And then some examples from previous years. And you have also an idea what your predecessors, your college students did a couple of years ago already. So let's look at here. There was one group getting started with workout, fitness. And they, you see, look, they had also these different phases. The awareness phase that people became aware that they want to do something. The preparation phase, the workout phase, evaluation and maintenance. You clearly can see here the trans-theoretical model coming back. That's good. Use this information. Also think about it. And at the top of it, it's all right. Who are the users? They use a bit of the persona and also the emotional. You can see what's going on. And they see the maintenance. Here they identify is looping back. It's this habit that you can start developing there. The goals they identified, the barriers, opportunity, the touch points, and also advanced action to advance the phone. So here they try to give an old overall overview of what is happening. Now let's take another one. So this was a group that worked on how to deal with, to overcome, to avoid hangovers. So drinking alcohol and combine it with your study life. And so they use a couple of ways to explain and to visualize the process. So first start with a storyboard, explaining what happens if someone is at home, there's no beer or drinks. Okay, there's some time. They go to the pub, meet their students, friends, start drinking, they are offering drinks. All right, you see all the trouble if they want to study next day and don't want to drink too much alcohol. Okay. So then they were thinking, all right, let's put it in a schematic way to explain what is happening. So what are the reasons, the motivated time, the money? So they sketch this out to say, all right, what was for them the difficult thing? So don't go to the bar, maybe that's the thing, but if you're at the bar, make sure you don't drink too much alcohol now and learn to say no. So how do you do this now? The next step, they make the whole map and here you can see, all right, the different faces again. Yes. At first, the discovery that there is the tool. So they focus here a bit on the tool instead of a person who realized that they want to control their alcohol consumptions because they want to make it sure that it's better aligned with the studying behavior. But then the next phase, going to the bar and before the bar, or going to the bar is the question, are you going or not? That's a decision. Then before you actually go and in the bar and the phase after. And there you can also see the ups and downs. And interestingly, at the end, what happens if the person didn't drink, that's great, but also have an idea the low point where they failed and they drink too much that they couldn't do the study. So they also have a bit of a different scenario, situations that could happen. And that's important. Yes. Because not always everyone will go to the same path. Okay. Then another group, they want to support people that they eat less meat. And by doing this, people have to get experience in what recipes you can actually have and the cooking. And by sharing people these recipes, we don't need meat. Then they hope that other people also start eating more menus and meals that doesn't use meat in it. So you see here that they put a lot of emphasis on the social connection and having people invited to prepare a meal, share a meal and to motivate them also to take on this idea of these recipes. And you see the loop because it's not just once, but multiple times you want to do this. Another group, a couple of years ago, they looked at toxic behavior of the League of Legends. And interesting in this group, they clearly make an idea how to map the outside the behavior, the application and inside. So inside the League of Legends and also outside when you would using or inside using the application that would support people to change that toxic behavior. Of course, there are some points how we can improve this. But I show this here, no idea about the emotions and the user outside the product that is also missing a bit. But good is already this idea that the third difference between the inside and outside the application. Even another one is excessive phone use, how you reduce that one. Also all these steps and ideas. But you see, these are more like flowcharts and less, as we saw before, like the one map where you could see the ups and downs. A couple of, from my own research projects. Years ago, we worked on the pocket negotiator that is a tool that support people to negotiate. And we started, for example, with all kinds of storyboards. Storyboards in this case is when a couple had to decide about what kind of house they want to buy. And they might have conflicting ideas about the house. And where the woman in this case is pregnant. She wants to have a house that is safe for their future baby. And the spouse is thinking about a nice garage for his car to work on now. And here you can see the leather getting a little bit of a fight. And then the system is helping them to calm down and to work together towards what is important for both of them and come to some solution. Okay. So this is a scenario, not yet a map, a behavior map. Another scenario. This was a project that we did to think about how you can support children or a family. And when, for example, a child goes out to the school and yes, still the parent wants to know is everything safe. And so how could you do that? Instead of any other things, the children also want to connect to other playmates in their areas. Yes. So how could you give the child this kind of ability to find other children and explore the neighborhood while also thinking about the parents who want the children being safe outside. And so now we looked at a kind of a way of doing this to give them a kind of an electronic partner for the whole family who could support both the children and the parents and try to solve, come up with a solution that the application didn't become big brother or restrict the personal, the child, but still give the parents a bit of an idea whether the children are safe or not while also supporting the autonomy of the children. Now you can see here one of those sketches. Here, a much more flowchart approach is what we did years ago when we developed a system for treatment. In this case, it was a virtual reality treatment for people with social anxiety. And the idea was here that people would take a box with a laptop and a visor, an SMD, home and would do the behavior at home. But before that, they would meet with a therapist and would explain this. Now here you can see all those steps. Meeting in the clinic, explaining, giving a demo, explain how the process of the therapy work. Then the patient is at home and then you break it up in different phases. The first is the first time they do it. And then later on you have a repeat because there are multiple sessions they have to do at home. And at the end they come back to the clinic. Now here you see also steps. Here you don't see what is missing because we didn't do it at that time. The emotion, the kind of problems people might think. So this again, early sketches, which could, if I look at it now, maybe improve by making an actual behavior map. Now also good when you make the map is to check the plan. Yes, so Wendell gives you a couple of ideas. So first of all, look at your persona. Look at your persona and go, make a walkthrough with your persona to the plan, the mind, the behavior plan. Is this what your persona would do? Does it make sense? Where are the barriers? What are the emotional reactions to it? This helps you again to put those ups and downs in your behavioral plan. Also indicate what things are easy for them. They are maybe familiar already or unfamiliar for them. And use notes and comments to put on your behavior plan. And we've seen that by the patient journey where you can show ideas of what actual patient would have said, but we could do it all in the sense of what your persona would have said. Now, again, it's a skills that people already have. Are they familiar with it or are they things they cannot do because they don't have experience? So indicate it because that is a problem. Yes. So for example, Obamacare, first time people might call a radio they haven't done before. They haven't also articulated clear arguments. All right. So in Obamacare, they make a couple of notes with what you could say. Okay. And also indicate the obstacles that these, your personas might come across. Yes. Do they have shoes to run? Do they know the telephone number of the show they want to call? Yes. These kinds of things. Also important, as Randall says, think about outside the product. Yes. Because I mentioned already, you have to look at the whole process, all the behaviors. But I know you guys, as soon as there's a computer involved, you only focus on the computer and the program. But the most important, most of the time, happens most outside the interaction with your product. So make sure there's also support. Once I mentioned before, Obamacare, that support, that whole discussion point. What could you say on the radio? What is your arguments? Why should people be in favor of Obamacare? So he gives it to them, help them outside when there is not a system that can find the telephone number for you and maybe extra information connects to the radio. But then you have to talk. Now, that is outside the product, but you also have to support that part of the behavior. Now, you can do this, give them guidelines, a manual, a booklet, all kinds of things. But also, thinking back to the hook model, because how are they coming back if you have a behavior? Remember at the end, you had to set them up for the next cycle. Is there another trigger to pull them back? So what is happening in your situation? How do people, if there's a recurring action, would the action recur? Where's the cue? Where's the trigger? Then also, if you check your behavior plan, is to see whether all steps, because most of the time people become very detailed, all kinds of steps, you might have to reduce a bit. And important there is to look for the minimal viable action. So when we talk sometimes in the industry about the minimal viable product, which is, if you want to develop a new product, is the product with the minimum number of functions to be there, the basic version of a product to be able to test the idea. So most of the time, you start with a minimal viable product if you build something, and to put that in the market and see if this works, because then you spend the least amount of money, but you have something viable to test your ideas. Now, the same you can do for the minimal viable actions. What is the minimal number of actions that is needed to see if your behavior plan is actually working? Yeah? And this is good to know, because later on, if you want to test your ideas, then you can see if these minimal viable actions are being achieved. So cut away everything what is not necessary, and make this, indicate these steps, because it's important for your development. Because later on, you can make sure that this stuff is actually working. The other may be less priority, but this is the key. If this is dropped out of your plan, in the sense, you wouldn't have a behavior. Yeah? So identify. Other things, then you can look at your map and think, alright, there might be obstacles there. Is there a way to remove those obstacles? And think about the exit funnel. Yes? One strategy was to cheat. Is there a way around that people don't have to do? Can I automate it? Yes? So Obamacare, remember, what did they do? People had to find those radio stations. You can do it automatically. Give them also the telephone number. So this step from the original behavior is gone. Yes? And it's also become the barrier that people think, should I do that? Can I do this? It's gone. It's already there. So look if there are something like that As I mentioned before, also look at repeating actions because these are kind of the behaviors that you might want to turn into a habit. So if they have to run each morning and for jogging or you remember for the cooking, each time you want to invite people and find a new recipe and cook, that you want to repeat. So in Obamacare, I don't think they try to establish a habit. Yes? They were more expecting to once call a radio station. Okay. But you might find a focus on a behavior that you want to establish and that creates into a habit. Now identify it and see if there's a reward afterwards and what is there to maintain the habit. Now, look back at the HOOP model. Is this kind of things in your plan? Okay. Another thing what you can look at is making steps easier. Sometimes steps are quite complex and people cannot cognitively process them. Yes? So if you say, all right, just call the helpline of the Obama, the radio show and make an argument. That's a lot to do in one thing. Yes? So you saw that they broke it up. So you have to find a quiet place, find a number, find a show, listen. Yes? And make it smaller sometimes. You have more steps but you make it smaller and it's easy to achieve. Same with quitting with smoking. One strategy is called turkey. You quit and then you stop and don't smoke. But you can also say, I do it, reduce it step by step, less and less and less. There's another strategy. The beauty of this thing is, is creating small steps also show to people they can achieve something, which they call small wins. Yes? And that's important, those small wins that helps people to write, I'm on the right track. Now we will look at it later. Another thing you can think is to make it simpler is to see if you can move the cognitive complexity into the system that takes it over. Yes? So we saw that already by the Obamacare where you don't longer have to look for numbers, telephone numbers or the show. The system is doing that. Now, often there's things you have to remember or to find out. Maybe you can already put that in the system that will do it for you. That helps. Okay. Other things you have to look at your plan is that maybe you have two small things. Maybe you can chunk them together, which you then label as one thing. And that we do, obviously, if we actually, if we have those faces, we recognize that these groups are belonging to each other. And this is a group belonging to each other. Now, help to identify that because you can then also communicate in this way to the users. Pitfalls. I mentioned already that's the small wins. Yes. So some people say, all right, the ultimate goal running the marathon. Yes, that is what the milestone what we achieved. That is true, of course. But to get to running the marathon, you have to convince a person that he's capable of doing that. And that's a challenge. Now, what you can do is to make sure that they have in the beginning small wins. Have an idea that you can do it because if you imagine you have to do the marathon or climb the whole mountain, you might stop. You think that's unachievable. Don't do it. But if you have a, all right, I did a bit of running for 10 minutes. I could do it. And I did win the first little competition. Yes. You boost your morale. Yes. You feel you can do it. And once you have a couple of these small wins, you're much more convinced to put up those higher challenges. Yes. So therefore make sure in your behavior plan, there's opportunities, for example, if people have to do a very complex thing, that they have a couple of success moments. Yes. So that they have to build their confidence before you have to let them do something which is really challenging. Okay. Lots of talking. So I hope that from this video, you now have an idea and have seen some examples to make a behavior plan. Yes. My strategy is first make it without supportive technology, only once you have that sorted out, build a plan with the technology and identify the touch points. Where are the low points? Where are the barriers? And here, think about what your technology can do. And once you have developed that, check it. Are the things to make easier? Can the things maybe identify as a habit? Can we have cheating routes that we can make it easier for people? Yeah. Okay. Thank you for watching this video and that we have finished the explore part of the site. See you in the next video.
