Summary of Lecture 6: Conceptual Design

- Topic: Conceptual Design
- Reference Material: Chapters 7, 9, and 10 of Wendel's book (both editions referenced)
- Key Steps in Design Model Covered: Exploring and crafting the intervention
- Objectives:
  - Learn to develop a behavior plan and support it with technology.
  - Learn to critically analyze the environment for behavior change.
  - Understand how to prepare the user for behavior change.
- Techniques Discussed:
  - Story editing to facilitate behavior change.
- Transition in Focus:
  - Moving from the understanding and discovery phase to the design phase.
- Specific Design Phase Elements Addressed:
  - Behavior plan
  - User stories
  - Interface design
  - Product design

By the end of this lecture, students should have a clear understanding of how to create a behavior plan that draws on both technology and a keen analysis of the user's environment and how to prepare users for behavioral changes using story editing. The lecture draws on foundational concepts from Wendel's book, providing a bridge from theory to practical application in design.

## Transcript

Welcome to lecture 6, Conceptual Design. In this video I'll give you a short introduction to this lecture, Conceptual Design. In the lecture we're going to look at two chapters, or actually three chapters, from the book Wendel. So we're going to look at materials in chapters 7, 9 and 10 in this lecture. And we're going to look at two steps of the design model, which is the exploring and crafting the intervention. After this lecture you should be able to develop a behavior plan, and support that also with technology, and critically analyze the environment in which people have to change their behavior and create this behavior. And we also want to look at preparing the user for this change. And here we will look at a specific technique and at the story editing. You will see that during those videos we're going to look forward in this lecture, we're going to follow a bit like the old version of the book I mentioned already. We're currently working with the second edition, but I'm also using most of the time the first edition. And in the first edition we are now moved from understanding discovery to the design phase, where you have the behavior plan, the user stories interface and product design. But this time we're going to look specifically at the behavior plan. Okay, so I hope you enjoyed this lecture and see you in the next videos.
