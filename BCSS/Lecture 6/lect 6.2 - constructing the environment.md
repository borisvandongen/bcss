### Summary: Constructing the Environment for Behavior Change

In this lecture, we critically analyze the design and analysis of the environment where behavior change is expected to occur, linking it to chapter nine and Wendel's DECIDE model. The environment for behavior change includes both social and physical contexts.

Here are the key takeaways from the lecture:

#### Definitions

- **Environment:** The context, including social and physical settings, where a behavior takes place.
- **DECIDE Model:** A systematic approach for crafting interventions, taking into account environmental factors that influence behavior.

#### Five Key Strategies in Environmental Construction for Behavior Change

1. **Increase Motivation:**
   - Utilize intrinsic motivation from existing behaviors to encourage new ones.
   - Apply extrinsic motivation carefully, especially for new or one-off behaviors.
   - Use positive reinforcement over punishment.
   - Match the motivator to the user.
   - Address present versus future rewards to emphasize immediate benefits.

2. **Cue the User to Action:**
   - Directly ask the person to perform the behavior, if appropriate.
   - Implementation intention: create mental triggers for action using environmental cues.

3. **Generate a Feedback Loop:**
   - Use the environment or support systems to provide feedback on progression towards goals.

4. **Remove Competition:**
   - Identify competing cues or distractions and address them by redesigning, joining, or outshouting them.

5. **Remove Obstacles:**
   - Identify and mitigate physical, social, or psychological barriers to the desired behavior.

#### Steps for Environmental Analysis

When analyzing the plan for behavior change, consider the following questions:
   - What motivates the person to complete each step in the behavior plan?
   - How is the system or environment helping to support motivation?
   - Are there environmental cues and clear feedback for performance?
   - Have you identified distracting elements that could derail behavior?
   - What obstacles might block the person from performing the behavior, and have all preconditions been addressed?

Utilizing these strategies and questions can help enhance the environment for effective behavior change interventions.

## Transcript

Constructing the environment. In this video, we will look at and do a critical analysis of designing and analyzing the environment which people have to do the behavior. And it is part of the crafting the intervention of we look at the DECIDE model of Wendel. So this connected to chapter nine, so we will look at parts of that. Okay, let's see it. So a person has to do the action, do the behavior in an environment. It could be a social environment or a physical environment, but it's set in a certain context. And so we should analyze this context. It could be the product itself, our behavior change support system. How is this in a sense creating an environment, but also the actual physical or social environment where they actually have to take place. And we're going to look at five ways Wendel suggests that you can consider this analysis and make steps to improve it. Okay, now let's start. Those five ways of looking at it is to ways to increase the motivation, cue the user to action, generate a feedback loop, remove competition and remove obstacles. Let's start with increasing the motivation. Motivation is important. We've seen it in previous videos already to make people do certain things. And you have to consider whether this is a new kind of things they have to do, or is it something they're familiar with? Start with the existence. Remind people that they have capable of doing that already. So for example, if you have to run to do the marathon, let's start that you, you're already walking. Yes. So you're capable of walking. Remind people you have been jogging before, maybe already. So you're already a sport person. Yes. So use this to build confidence and see the motivation. Like do you like walking? Yes. Do you like a little bit of journey? Yeah. So use the familiar to start moving to the unfamiliar, the new stuff. Yes. So use this motivation that they have already with the existing behavior to build to the new one. That is building basically on the intrinsic motivation they have already from the existing behavior. But we build in some cases to something new, and then we might need to support also put in extrinsic motivation from the outside. Now you have to be careful for that. We mentioned that already in previous videos. But in some cases it's possible to use extrinsic motivation. So for example, when there is very low intrinsic motivation for a specific step. So if there's one or two specific steps and you can identify those steps, all right. We throw in extrinsic motivations and the rewards or these kinds of things. Specifically for actions which are just a one-off. So if you get them over the hurdle, then you can continue. Yes, just getting over the hurdle, you don't have to do it again. Then extrinsic motivation might be sensible. Another case might also be helpful. For example, if people have no experience in this new behavior. And experience is because people use the experience to feel comfortable to do something. But if they don't have the experience, they might not feel comfortable to do something. So chicken and egg problem. How do I get them to do something to become comfortable of doing something? Now here you might, for the first cycle of this, when people have for the first time exposed to this new behavior, you might throw in the extrinsic motivation. But be careful there because sometimes the extrinsic motivation might not last after you remove it. And we talked about in the other video, possible feedback, positive feedback is one of the intrinsic motivation that would not hurt the intrinsic motivation later on. Then motivation, also be careful with punishment. Some suggest you can do that, that people have to pay things or have to do things that they might not want to do if they don't commit to the behavior. Be careful with it. It's better to see positive rewards, build something. Because most of the time they're more ethical than punishment strategies. Then also type of motivation. Find the right motivation for your specific user, yes. You have multiple motivators, but you don't know which one is working for your user. So figure out which one is really working for them and try to motivate them and that. Also another challenge might be the challenge you might have with the current versus future rewards or motivation. So sometimes I have to do now something what I don't like to get a reward in the future. Yes, so I have to brush my teeth now. So the reward in the future is I don't get all those health problems in my mouth. But yeah, that's difficult because why should I? I can do more fun things than for this future guy, which I will see over a couple of years, 10, 20 years when my teeth have a problem, then I will sort it out. That's how people might think. So you have to bring it to the now situation. What is the benefit from it now? Now you then have to come up with benefits for now. Could be, all right, after brushing your teeth, you have a fresh breath. You might find it more interesting to socially connect with you than you have a breath, which is a bit appalling. So now you bring a benefit in the here and now, yes. Now there has been some research that people find it very difficult to connect with their future now because it might be like almost like a faraway person. So what they've done, they use face graphics technique to show how you might be looking in the future. And then also explain who you are in the future. And then you bring this person from the future much to the now. Now there seems to be some effect. For example, there's some done some research about how willing people would be to put money aside for the retirement fund when they were confronting with their future self. Okay, so that's maybe another way. Now let's move on to what we can do with the environment. One important is make sure there are cues for action. We've seen it in the action funnel, in the hook model, there is always this cue necessary. Now, one particular cue, you cannot do it all the time, is just to ask a person to do some such a thing. Yes. So in some cases, very plain forward, ask him to do something can really be helpful, but don't do it all the time. You cannot just easily ask, can you do this, can you do this? And it becomes kind of annoying. But in some cases, it might be helpful to do this. And it helps to get the attention to make sure that people, I noticed the cue, and people might feel obliged to do it. Because if you ask politely, yeah, people are more likely to do things. And it also creates a sense of urgency. Yes. All right. The ask being now, you have to do something now and might actually do it now. Because the timeliness of the request is important there. Do people really feel they have to do it now? Now, another strategy is this cue to action is to create those cues in a sense. Because yeah, it might be things in the environment that might remind you to do some things, but people might not be reminded by the objects in the environment. Implementation intention is a technique where you sit down and imagine the future, what you would do in a certain situation. And you create kind of triggers. So if I imagine, if you say, look, if I get into the room and I see the vacuum cleaner, I will pick it up and do two minutes of hoovering. Yes. Now, now I've created a kind of an if-then situation. If I come in this room, I see the vacuum cleaner, two minutes, yes. So now I create the vacuum cleaner is now becoming a cue. So now that is a strategy you can use for implementation intention. Okay. Other way you can use the environment is to give feedback about your behavior. Yes. Use the environment to tell how well you're doing it. Now that's it. For example, the feedback. Yeah. That's your environment. In this case, the application that tells you how many steps you've done, how much you're already on your way to achieve your goal. So use the environment to give people feedback about how well they are doing about their goal and their behavior. Okay. Then removing competition. Often in the environment, there might be distractions, other entities that draw people's attention. And yeah, how do you deal with this is a, is a, is a, what, first of all, is what are these competitions? What are the other cues? Try to identify them because otherwise you have no clue what you're up against. Then think about is, can you move the person from another environment or is there a way to deal with the kind of other competitors? So first of all, what you can do is if it is in your own product, if you have your product saying, look, look at this video or fill in this form and then you're competing with yourself. So then you can redesign the application, of course, then you say, all right, the video needs first to be seen. All right. Make sure that is, this is the first thing you ask. Once that is completed, you ask the second thing. Yes. That's the easy one. Some cases it's not within your own application, but it's too competing with another, maybe another application or another thing. So instead of trying to fight it, you can join them in a case. If you cannot beat them, join them. That might be the strategy. So what sometimes you see people, they identify that people are often on Facebook that might draw their attention away from your application. So why not offer your application through Facebook? That's one strategy. Yes. So that might also be an idea. So make sure then that your queue is connected with the other queue which competes. And then a last alternative, of course, is if that is not a possibility, make sure that your queue is noticed better. So shout louder for attention than the other one. That is one. Yeah. Very blunt strategy, but at least something which you sometimes have to do. So make sure that people not easily, yeah, don't see your queue or something. Yeah. Okay. Now the remove obstacles, identify the obstacles. So we've seen that in the previous video already. If you have to start running, you need obstacles is that you need the shoes or that you shouldn't have a large lunch before. Yes. So, but it could also be psychological obstacles and people might have no skills for it or not the confidence for that. Try to find what the problems are and then you can start designing a way to solve them. Yeah. But at least you need to know that first. Okay. So just to summarize, because now you can also use these steps to analyze your behavior plan. So first, what are the motivations for a person to do all those steps in your behavior plan? And what is your system doing to support this motivation? Are there already kind of social or physical motivation in place to help people to do the things that they find difficult? How will people be queued in the environment? Will they get the environment clear feedback about their performance? And is there also indication how to improve that? Now let's look again at your plan. Is there again, distracting elements? Is there something that stops people when they go outside running that they have to pass? All right. The television screen, which will put them, all right, maybe I don't want to go to where there's also no fun. I can't watch television. So maybe you have to make sure that they take the other door outside before they do the running. Yes. This could be simple things. And think again, what blocks person? Yes. Are all the preconditions set for necessary to a person to actually be able to do the behavior that you want them to do? Okay. I hope you enjoyed this video and see you in the next one.
