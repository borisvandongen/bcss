Summary of the Technology Adoption Lifecycle Lecture:

The Technology Adoption Lifecycle explains the varying speeds and phases at which people adopt new technologies. Understanding this model is crucial for those who plan to introduce new products to the market, as it outlines the different types of users and their evolving needs and demands over time. Below are the key concepts discussed in the lecture.

1. **Diffusion Process**: This refers to how an innovation spreads through a social system. Some technologies are adopted quickly, while others may take years before they reach a wide user base.

2. **Innovation Adoption Key Characteristics**:
   - **Relative Advantage**: The greater the perceived advantages, the faster the adoption rate.
   - **Compatibility**: Technologies that are compatible with existing systems are adopted more readily.
   - **Complexity**: Simpler innovations are adopted more easily than complex ones.
   - **Trialability**: The ability to test an innovation can speed up its adoption.
   - **Observability**: Clearly observable benefits encourage quicker adoption.

3. **Communication Channels**: The diffusion process involves communication channels through which information about an innovation travels from those who know about it to those who don't.

4. **Social Systems**: Innovations must fit within the social systems they enter, accounting for existing norms, regulations, roles, and opinion leaders. Change agents and aides are individuals who support others in adopting innovations.

5. **Time**: There are different time dimensions to consider in the diffusion process, including the time it takes for an individual to decide to adopt an innovation and the rate at which the innovation is adopted within the larger population.

6. **Adoption Categories**:
   - **Innovators (2.5%)**: Willing to take risks and are usually connected to external communities. They are gatekeepers for new technologies.
   - **Early Adopters (13.5%)**: Integrated within their community and often serve as opinion leaders, making their approval critical for broader adoption.
   - **Early Majority (34%)**: Deliberate before adopting and rely on opinions from early adopters.
   - **Late Majority (34%)**: Skeptical and economically driven, adopting mainly due to peer pressure and proven practicality.
   - **Laggers (16%)**: Traditionally inclined and very cautious about new innovations, often isolated within their social networks.

7. **Application in Practice**: This model can be applied to specific areas such as e-mental health, in which professionals progress through stages of non-use, minimal, passive, active, and innovative use, each with different motivations, emotions, and barriers.

In conclusion, the lecture stresses the importance of understanding where potential users fall on the technology adoption curve and tailoring strategies to engage them based on their characteristics, needs, and the social system they operate within.

Technology Adoption Lifecycle. In this video I want to explain about the Technology Adoption Lifecycle. And what explains how people, if technology is being introduced, how people adopt these technologies. You will see that there are different groups of people adopting earlier or later. And they have different characteristics. In different phases there are different things going on. So it's good to understand it. Because when you want to bring your product to the market, you could say, you might have to consider that over time you get a new kind of set of users with different needs and demands. That's what we can talk about. So first talk about the diffusion process. So if you look at different products being released or introduced, you see some are taking way longer for you have lots of people who start using it. So you can see that there are different kind of slopes and speeds in which people adopt. Some innovations go very quick and easy. People see the benefits, have quick adopted. Some take years before you have a large impact. Now, this idea about these different phases, that's what you're going to look at. Yes, so we're going to look at how innovations change things, how it's just communicated with certain channels, and how this over time changes because you get different people working with your application. And also to consider the members in this social system, you could say. What are the roles to motivate people or to have them using this system? Okay, now let's first start what we talk about innovation. So innovation could be an idea or a practice or technology that individuals or organizations start adopting, using it. And what you have to understand what is technology often doing if you really try people start using a new tool set, is that it often helps them to reduce uncertainty. And this might sit a bit fake. So when they were developing this model, they were considering tractors. So for farmers, so if you start using this kind of technology, you have less risk that your crops might die or something. So there's less certainty that you can plan your activity. Now, that is what technology in these cases could bring about. Now, there are key characteristics in this diffusion process. First of all, the relative advantage. So if there are more advantages, you will see that the diffusion goes much faster. People can say, yeah, that really helps. I also want to have that. Compatibility. If this new technology is compatible with previous idea or previous technology, yes, and it is easily integrated. So you see, it's ready, easier to adopt. The complexity. If it is very complex and difficult, this new idea, it takes more time. If it is very simple, all right, less effort, people can adopt. Tryability. Can people try it? Or do they have to just accept it and then hope for the best? Yeah. So if people can try already your application, see if they like this. All right. It's much easier than to accept or to try and to do it. And then, yes. So to make this decision, otherwise you have no grounds to base your decision on, just to hear what other people say. So tryability, if your application is allowing people to try and to see. Now, that you can often see in application, by the way. Hey, you get a trial version. That is about this thing. Allowing people to try it, to taste a little bit. And this ability improves the diffusion process. Observability. Is it clear that you can observe the benefits? If you say no, if you use this application, then it will, over 20 years, you have less risk of lung disease. It's very difficult. But can you really say no? In three days, you will feel much more air in your lungs. Now, then it's much more observable. Yes. So it's important that people can quickly see the difference that it makes. Okay. Let's move to the other thing. So we talked about innovation, the communication channel. Yes. So communication is a process where you have two actors trying to commute or share information and to reach a kind of mutual understanding. Now, in this process, you have the innovation. Then you have the individual on one side who knows about it. And then on the other side, you have the person who doesn't know about it. And in between, you have the channel, the communication. Now, normally you have to realize that communication is among peers that have a kind of an equal level of information. Now, diffusion process is often not the case. Then there's one party who knows everything and the other party that lacks this knowledge. Excuse me. So be aware of that. And that you might be talking to users who not know everything and so cannot assume that they understand everything you're saying. Then you also have to think that a diffusion process is acting in a social system. So imagine that you want to change, for example, we talked about it before, hands hygiene, that you clean your hands in a hospital, the nurses. You have to understand that you're operating in a hospital. That is a social system with different people with different roles. There are different procedures. So the diffusion has to work within this system. Yes. And should use the structure. So you might have to pick to explain to managers why this should be done because they control whether new gel dispensers would be installed. Yes. So that different people in a social system that need to be aligned before such an innovation takes place. Also in a system there are norms and regulation how things have to be in a hospital. The safety norms, kind of legal, ethical ideas about who your professional operate. Yes. So these rules, normset also determines whether this innovation that you're suggesting fits. Then important also in a social setting, there are opinion leaders. These people have an opinion and people listen to them. So if you want to change an innovation, you have to make sure that those opinion leaders are having an opinion about and hopefully a positive opinion about the innovation that you say. If they not expressing things, no one, because there's opinion leaders, shape the opinion in an organization. And this organization could be actually even a nation or something. So sometime your initial focus might be on the opinion leaders. So they start communicating. If they say, look, I've seen this app and it's really wonderful. All right. People start listening. Yes. Okay. Then you have to change agents. These are individuals that can help people to take on the innovation. So you can think about help desk that can help people. That could also be a bit trainers that explain things or other nurses that help you to do something. Yes. Or they support you on the way to change you. Then you have the aid. So the aid could be not a fully professional as the change agent, but it might be another client. So someone who already is a little bit ahead with using this application can tell the others, oh, when I used it, I did this or this and this. So that could also be helpful. Time. Now in a diffusion process, there are different time dimensions going on. So it's the time, for example, that people do make a decision to move to and use this new innovation. So that is the time that they first hear from it. That's the time they take to change their attitude towards deciding that they want to accept this new kind of technology. Then there's a time dimension about innovativeness. So how early is the individual, if you look at the population, of taking on a new innovation? Some people are really keen to try new things out. Some people are like, look, I want to see everyone else. And then maybe I make up my mind to see whether it is smart to do. Then the innovation have also a rate of adoption. We talked about already earlier. Some innovations to reach out to a general population takes years to reach. Others go very quickly. So that's the rate of the adoption. OK. Now, what you often see when we talk about adaptation is this kind of Knorr curve, this Gaussian distribution, which splits up a whole population. So it splits up, you say, look, if we have the whole population, then we have a group which we call the innovators. Then we have a group of 35% of early adopters. Then 34, or 13, 1, 3, 0.5 for the early adopters. Then 30, 3, 4, the early majority. There's a large group already. Then 34, the late majority. And then 60 is the laggers. Now, where do those percenters come from? Ah, that's simple. It's just the normal distribution. One standard deviation, two standard deviations. So it's just a definition where to cut people in groups. But it's interesting because if you look at this, so these early innovators are the first people to take on an innovation. Later, you got the early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggers. So these are groups that consequently take on a new innovation, or they're normally keen on doing this. Now, let's look at the innovators. So often they are a bit outside the community and they're more connected to other communities. So they are looking for new kinds of risks and new kinds of opportunities. So these are the kind of technology-savvy people or investors in new kinds of ideas. And they communicate also with other people who are interested in new innovations. And they might be not always closely, physically together, but maybe on the internet, have their community. So researchers, you could see, yes? They have connections all over the world with other research groups. And you see, they try new and to innovate things. They also most of the time are the people who have the ability and kind of resources to try all these new innovations and the complexity that comes with understanding the things. Because most of the time, the initial innovation, when you use it, it's quite clumsy, you don't understand it. And later, people make it much easier. And the design is improved. So to begin, it might be quite hard. So you need these people that are willing to spend a little bit more time to understand how the application works. And these people can cope also with uncertainty. So they're quite happy or understand that things might fail, that the application might not work. But they try to see the potential and therefore they try to it. Now, these individuals, the innovators, are a kind of gatekeepers to the community. They try and see whether things work. And if they think it's not working, it's not getting through in the community. So they are the gatekeepers. Only when they say, all right, it seems to work, then it starts going in to the system. Then what you often get is it moves to the early adopters. So they are more integrated with the social system, where the innovators were more on the outside, connecting with other communities. Here you have the community where you have the early adopters. Now, often these are also the opinion leaders. These are the people in the organization, the first one to use these kind of systems. And they also inform others in the community about the system. And that's important because if you want to spread to the next generation, the groups following up the early majority is listening to the early adopters, to these opinion leaders. Yes, so it's important if you develop. So once you have the innovators test your system and start using it, now the focus should be on the opinion leaders to let them experience and see the benefits. So they, in a sense, are a role model. So if people look at them and think, all right, if these guys are using it and they seem to enjoy it, all right, I believe this person, I also might try to do this. And once that, it often what we call from moving from the early adopters to the early majority is a kind of trigger moment. So the critical mass after this comes here. So if you have not the opinion leaders with you, you're not going to motivate those critical mass after that. Okay. Yeah, so early adopters put their stamp of approval, the new idea. So that's why you need the opinion leaders. They, you could say, look, they are looking at this thing and say, if they say it's an okay, then other people say, all right, let's move. Then we move to the early majority. Now you're talking about the large group people starting to, but you can split them up in the early and the late majority. So these are people who take a much longer before they start using it, but they are a bit before the average group than the others that comes with it. So they interact with each other. I can see here also on the slide that you can do and provide interconnection in the system. Okay, so they follow and they don't lead. Now then the late majority, that's a much more conservative and they might also do it for different reasons. So they might be much more economically motivated and increase in peer pressure. They might have a more skeptical about and cautious. So this is also something important to consider when you introduce a new application. So if you just hand it out to everyone, people here in the late majority might not be the people that you first try to get your applications to in contact. So they might be way critical, but they might be some people that you might reach in five years from now. So if there's an early innovation of your system, you might be talking about your users that is in five years. And you might first in start want to talk about your early adopters. Yes, so be aware. If people are very critical, try to understand where they normally are positions in this curve. Okay, so the fair norm, they try to follow what others are doing and the resources are a bit limited. The others might have more resources, money, time and effort to spend. And so they want to reduce any risk, therefore, and try to avoidance of risk. Now, then the last group, you have the laggers. So that's not the part that they follow the opinion leaders or the initial opinions in this. So most of the time, they're also very locally organized and isolated in the network. Often you could characterize them, what they say, as a reference point in the past and traditional values. Now, a bit suspicious about new thing. Now, I have put in the picture of the old armies. So his idea is that it's important also that you consider these people in a set if you have laggers, because they might never accept your application and might never want to adopt to it. And so this might be a bridge too far if you want to reach out to them. So you might, if you run into this in your focus group, consider where they are. Are they completely opposed to any new kind of technologies? That might be difficult to change them to this adaptation. So have an idea where those people are when in this kind of process, what we talk about in adoption. Okay, now I've been talking about the very generic ideas about this technology adoption cycle, but you could also see this being used in specific areas. So one, here's a paper, recent paper, where they used this to think about e-mental health for psychologists. So you could also see how psychologists would step through this adoption of technology and what would happen in different phases. So you might have a phase one where they don't want to use it and then move on to minimal use, then passive use, then active use, and innovative reuse. And if people are in different steps where they are, there are also different drivers that motivate them. First, there might be something they try or the manager says they have to do it, but later they might see the benefit and then think, okay, this is something I really want to use because I see that my clients also benefit. And that they're also feeling different emotions that are going on and barriers that they are tackling. So it's important that you consider this, because if you bring new technology to an organization, these people might have to come from very far to you, in a sense, to use this application. So maybe you have no experience about using these kinds of technologies and they have to learn, so be aware of this. And take this into account that you might have to take a bit more steps, more teaching, you have to have opinion leaders there, having the ability that they could try it, that all help them to go quicker to this diffusion of the technology. Okay, so there was a lot to take in. To summarize, so you have these different phases. You have to consider there's a whole community that you have to talk to. And different phases, you might want to talk to different people. So sometimes you have to talk to the early innovators to try the other gatekeepers. Then you have the early adopters with the opinion leaders. Then you follow the mass, where you have the early adopters who have a bit more resources often. Then the late adopters have to be much more stricter and risk-avoidant. And then the laggers, maybe you can never reach out to them. Okay, that's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it.
