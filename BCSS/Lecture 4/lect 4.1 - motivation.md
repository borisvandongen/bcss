### Summary of Lecture on Motivation

#### Definitions:
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: The drive that comes from within an individual to engage in an activity for its own sake, due to personal interest, enjoyment, or satisfaction.
- **Extrinsic Motivation**: Motivation fueled by external rewards such as money, grades, or praise. Individuals engage in an activity not for enjoyment but for what they will receive in return.

#### Self-Determination Theory (SDT):
SDT is a theory of motivation that considers three fundamental factors influencing motivation:
1. **Competence**: Feeling capable of performing an action effectively.
2. **Autonomy**: Having the freedom to make choices and the sense of being in control of one's own behavior.
3. **Relatedness**: Feeling a sense of connection with others and feeling cared about by others.

According to SDT, these factors influence an individual's self-motivation. Without initial interest in the activity itself, these factors may not lead to motivation.

#### Effects of Extrinsic Motivation:
Extrinsic rewards can sometimes undermine intrinsic motivation by:
- Diminishing the sense of free choice.
- Reducing self-reported interest in the activity.
- Affecting the engagement and quality of the activity negatively.

However, positive feedback as a form of extrinsic motivation can enhance intrinsic motivation.

#### Continuum of Motivation:
Motivation can range from completely extrinsic to fully intrinsic, with different considerations such as the type of regulation (who controls the behavior), locus of causality (why an action is taken), and relevance of the regulation process (alignment with personal values).

- **A-motivation**: Lack of motivation where actions are not regulated.
- **External Regulation**: Behaviors are driven by external rewards or punishments.
- **Introjected Regulation**: Actions are influenced by ego (pride or shame) but are not fully internalized.
- **Identified Regulation**: Recognizing the personal value of an activity, aligning with one's own values.
- **Integrated Regulation**: Incorporating behaviors and values into one's self, still influenced by external rewards.
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Activities are pursued purely for pleasure and personal gratification.

#### Key Points:
- Aim to foster intrinsic motivation where possible.
- Teachers and behavior change systems should consider competency, autonomy, and relatedness in their approach.
- Reward systems can be beneficial if used correctly, such as through positive feedback.
- Understanding where individuals are on the motivation continuum can help in developing effective behavior change support systems.

The lecturer emphasizes the importance of intrinsic motivation for genuine engagement and learning, while also acknowledging the role of extrinsic motivators and the necessity to strike a balance between the two to effectively motivate students.

Motivation. In this video I want to talk about motivation and specifically I want you to know after this video the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation as well as the self determination theory. Okay now let's start. So extrinsic versus intrinsic motivation. These difficult words they like to throw them in. All right intrinsic motivation is the motivation that you have bring from yourself. So you're really interested to do something. It's not someone else who tells you or gives you a reward. That's the extrinsic motivation that someone gives you a reward and although you're not interested in doing the thing itself, you would stop doing it if you didn't get a reward. Interesting you get enjoyment of doing the thing by yourself. You don't need external stimuli or encouragement and that's the real difference. And of course as teachers we always hope that our students are interesting, intrinsic motivated to learn. But we also recognize that sometimes it helps to give them points and credits and that is the extrinsic motivation. Maybe they just want to get a degree. They're not interested in the material but the students we hope that you're interested also in the material really to learn what we're teaching and that is the intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic. Okay now the question of course is if you start extrinsic motivation would it hurt people's intrinsic motivation? So if I give you a reward would you then be less really motivated in a sense intrinsic motivation in the material than if I stop giving you rewards for it. So if I stop giving you the credits for passing the course would you then still be interested in the topic we are talking about or are you so passionate about it you don't need the degree you just want to know what I'm telling you. Now let's see. There have been some research about what are the effects if you provide extrinsic motivation on intrinsic motivation. Overall it's not working that well. Most of the time it's a negative effect that extrinsic motivation have intrinsic motivation. So for example it undermines the feeling of a free choice of interesting motivation. People will have if they report they could did it because they wanted to quit with smoking or they want to lose weight and but if you're gonna pay them for example they will tell they at the end became less interesting motivated and they more went for the money in a sense. And that could mean that is when they engage in the activity or that to complete the activity or how well they did the activity. All these activities are effective if you start providing extrinsic motivation on intrinsic motivation negatively. What also undermines is a self-reported interest. So if you ask people how much were you interested in doing this from your own kind of interesting motivation that is negative. Yes so it's kind of engaging or completing the the whole treatment or the intervention. If you have to pay and give all this reward they start saying I didn't just do it because I were interested in the thing to do to quit. But I did it for kind of the encouragement this stuff that I get around it. However there's one point where it is improving intrinsic motivation and that is the positive feedback. So if you use extrinsic motivation in the form of positive feedback. So all right you did it very well you acknowledge your approval yes you did a good job. So maybe I give you the points give kind of an acknowledgement that you did it right this exam is a kind of positive feedback. So you might still then build your interesting motivation. Okay so remember be careful when you use extrinsic motivation because it could harm the intrinsic motivation. There's one exception is if you use this external motivation element when you use it as positive feedback. Okay now let's move to a theory about motivation and one familiar or known theory is a self-determination theory SDT. And it has three factors which determines people's self-motivation. It is competence so how well do people feel competent that they can do something. Autonomy how much is it your decision or can you decide how to do it or you want to do it. And the last one is relatedness. So how much do you relate to the topic or the people around you doing this. Now these three are key factors that determine your self-motivation. Now think about it back so we have competence autonomy and relatedness. So competence is that you need to know that you really have the feeling that you're capable of doing the action. And that if you have this feeling and we've seen this before another theory it's more likely that you feel inclined to do this. If you think you cannot do it or the signals that you get from around people that you are not competent of doing this you're less motivated. Yes so if you think you cannot do weight loss and you are incapable of this it's less going to happen. Autonomy it's an important thing if you think about it all this forcing people to do something might really be harmful this self-motivation yes because you have no free choice anymore. And it's important because lots of interventions they say people should do step a then b and then c. But what is in it for me as a user like I don't want to do a I want to start with b and I don't like c. But if you have no option of choice then your autonomy gets less and then people are less happy about it and self-motivated. So when developing a behavior change system therefore you have to think about what is it for the student to choose the user. Maybe they like do it in this way to quit with smoking. Maybe they don't like the one like cold turkey that you have to stop immediately. But maybe they like it to do with every day one secret less or something. Maybe that is not even the best what the the clinical guideline says. But the important thing is to figure out how you can motivate people and so if they you give them the options they feel that they are in control and then the sense of autonomy. Yeah so keep in mind Relatedness. So that's about do the is there a sense of security or a relatedness. Now relatedness could actually be if you do this with a group of people that might be really motivated. Now where you could see this for example is in the army. Yes so sometimes if you read the reports back in these stories anecdotal stories why people keep fighting even if there's a hopeless course is they do it because of their bodies. Yes they don't want to let them down. So you have this strong cohesion relatedness that motivate people to do certain things. Yes so in the I think in the in the first world war England knew that so they put all kinds of regiments together where people from the same community. So they feel this relatedness or they were fighting and operating together in groups with people they knew already from when they were born. Now you don't want to turn your back on all these people you know already. So this motivates people because they are related to each other. Now if you think about the behavior change support system is it possible that you can create this coherent between a group that people feel related. So maybe they just dare and keep on going because they don't want to let the others down because if they quit they may also the others may also quit. Yeah so that is another way. Now self-limitation theory says look at all these three factors don't really play a role if people have no interesting motivation initially. So you cannot do just the three make someone competent and allow the autonomy you can take and you can make your own decisions and look everyone around you is willing. If you're not really interested in the task itself. Yeah so there it says is the starting point. Okay now if you think of self-determination is also a kind of a continuum. You can look at what kind of actions if you start with completely extrinsic motivation until interesting motivation. What happens? Now there are different dimensions that you can consider. Is the type of regulation who is controlling your behavior? Is it you? Is it something else? Or are you starting trying to control your own behavior? The locus of causality. Is it because you do something or is it that something else happens that changed the world? And the relevance of the regulation process. Is it something what you take as something that you agree with? Or is it something that all right your boss want this to happen? Okay so if you put it together you can create a whole matrix and that helps to understand where you are if you develop a behavior change support system. So on the complete opposite side of completely intrinsic motivation you have a motivation. Basically it's not an there is not relevant people motivated or not. It's not regulated. You have to do it or people have don't do it at all. Now so these are situations there is not a choice. Everyone walks and and you cannot stop walking or something. That is so it's not about motivation anymore. Now when you have motivation if we start moving in so you have the external regulation external compliance. So these are the kind of things people do the extrinsic motivation because otherwise they get punishment or they're heavily rewarded. So they're not doing it because they like the action so much. So for example let's consider running the marathon yes. You run the marathon not you like running the marathon but you get a million dollars yes or euros. Here you have a clear motivation don't like running but the money is great yes and the regulation yeah right the person who gives the money regulates how hard I will run and do the marathon. Then if you move a little bit more to the self-interested motivation you have this introjectional regulation and and here you're not fully accepting the regulation as your own but still you take pride that you could do it. So even if you were not happy about this running the marathon just showing off to other people that you could do that to set your mind to get the million euro is something that is good for your ego even if you don't care about running the marathon. Yes this is something to do with the pride that you might get or the shame that you feel if you're not achieving that. Now that's introjectional regulation. Now identified regulation is that you now start accepting that running the marathon is something healthy for you to do. Yes so now accepting this thing but it really helps that you get the million dollars. Yes so you can start seeing that these values of what you're doing now make sense also with the values of the actions. So initially you were not interested in running the marathon but now you start seeing now the marathon is aligned with my motivation become a healthy person and active physically. Yes so it makes sense now at the end of the skill if you're still talking about the experiencing motivation you have this integrated regulation. Now you really see this as part of what you're trying to do. You try to do it and you try to regulate it. It becomes internal still and you benefit from this external reward. Yes so if you would remove that completely then you might not still be able to do it on your own. Hey you don't do it completely for the fun of it and the enjoyment of it and that if you really start doing that then you moved from extrinsic to intrinsic motivation. Now you really do the running of the marathon. No one has to tell you reward you or something. You are in it for the fun and the pleasure of doing the marathon. Now see you have this whole continuum where you can think about it and that's you also have to consider when you develop a behavioral change support system. Where am I and where is my user of my application. Is they are they doing it just to get the points or are they quite motivated themselves but still giving some rewards positive feedback could help them because they find it still difficult to use put all the motivation out of getting out of this doing this activity. Yeah all right now summarizing it again. So there are two big distinction if we look at motivation intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. An extrinsic motivation is something we often do by trying to reward people or punish people to do something. But if you could build intrinsic motivation then people would do it by themselves because they are see the benefits and like to do it or the thing the activity. Then what we talked about was again the self-determination theory which indicate three important factors. People feel the competent that they can do the action. They feel have a level of autonomy that there's choice there and relatedness. So can they relate with other people to do this. Okay so that's this video. I hope you enjoyed it and see you in the next video.
