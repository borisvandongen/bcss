### Summary of Goal Setting Theory Lecture

**Goal Setting Theory**: The goal setting theory posits that setting goals can enhance individual performance.

**Key Components**:
- **Goal Setting to Performance**: The process starts with setting a goal which leads to better performance, then to satisfaction and rewards, and finally to the commitment to new challenges.
  
- **Moderators**: Factors that influence the strength of the relationship between goal setting and performance include:
   - Goal Commitment: Higher commitment to goals increases the likelihood of achievement.
   - Importance of the Goal: Greater importance placed on the goal motivates individuals to strive harder.
   - Self-Efficacy: Belief in oneâ€™s ability to achieve the goal bolsters efforts towards goal attainment.
   - Task Complexity: More complex goals demand a higher level of skill and may motivate people to develop new strategies.
  
- **Mechanisms**: 
    1. Direction: Goals provide focus on what needs to be done, eliminating irrelevant activities.
    2. Energy: Clear goals allow for the energizing of efforts towards goal attainment.
    3. Persistence: Goals encourage sustained effort, especially through difficulty.
    4. Activation of Strategy Development: Difficult goals may stimulate creativity and innovative problem-solving.

**Findings**:
- **Difficulty Level**: A linear relationship exists between goal difficulty and performance; higher difficulties lead to better performance until a point where the goal becomes unattainable and counterproductive.
- **Specificity**: Specific goals correlate with higher performance because they clarify what needs to be accomplished.

**Conclusion**: The goal setting theory suggests that specific and moderately challenging goals can positively impact an individual's motivation and performance. Key moderators and mechanisms must be considered to enhance this relationship, with factors such as commitment, importance, feedback, and self-efficacy playing critical roles.

goal setting theory. In this video I'll explain the goal setting theory and afterwards you should be able to explain why people are more productive or perform much better if they set themselves goals and explain also why that is happening. Also you should be able to know what things might improve actually this relation between setting goals and achieving this thing. So let's focus now on the whole theory. So here we have a figure of the connection between the different factors. So we have the goal setting which leads to performance. Performance itself is achieved that leads to satisfactions and rewards. Now this rewards then again leads to commitment to a new challenge which then has an impact on the moderating of the relation between goals and performance. Because now you might have previous experience which influences how well you are committed to these goals that you have set in the future. The other part is the mechanisms. So there are different mechanisms going on when you set yourself goals and why people are more productive or have a higher performance. Okay but first I suggest we kind of focus between the relationship between this goal setting and performance. What is happening there? So there are two major findings from the literature if we see between the relationship between goal setting and the performance. The first one is difficulty level. There is a linear relationship between the difficulty you set your goals and how much performance you see in the other hand. And that makes sense because for example if I set myself the goal of jumping twice up and down or if I set myself the goal of jumping up and down 20 times then if I actually look how many times I jump up and down I bet that in a condition when I said twice I jump way less than when I set myself a goal of 20. Yes so if you set higher goals you will see observe also a higher performance. Now of course that's a limit to it yes because you cannot indefinitely go if I give myself a goal let's jump up and down three million times I think ridiculous I'm never going to make it so I just abandon this goal. Yeah yeah so there's a limit until you people can perform this and if you go over that the goal is too complicated then the whole call idea collapse. Then specific specificity yeah how specific are your goal setting the more specific you are the more likely you see a higher performance and that makes sense if I would set my goal as all right do a bit of up and down jumping compared to jump 20 times up and down then it's much clearer what I'm supposed to do and where I can when I could stop because just jumping up and down a couple of times yeah it's fake I don't know when I reach my goal so if you're very specific you see that the the increase of the performance. Okay now why is this happening and that in a goal setting theory you have the mechanisms so there are a number of mechanisms explaining why setting a goal in has such an impact in the actual performance now four mechanisms can be identified let's start with the first one so a goal serves as to direct the function so what are we going to do so if you set a function like like look we're gonna go there and we want to move to that side of the the room here then it gives direction I'm not going that way I'm not going that way I just ignore everything that's just about going this or that way because now I'm focused that way yes so it makes helps me to make a distinction what is relevant and not relevant in achieving this goal um the second mechanism so it also is an energizing function because I have a goal now I know what to do I can energize myself and create lots of energy to achieve it if I have no goal yeah what should I do maybe there or there yes so by setting goals people try to find means to achieve this kind of thing so that helps um also the third mechanism is persistence because you have yourself set yourself a goal and if you're committed to this and your ability to control how much effort you can put in now you can really really go for it and really try to achieve it yes so it also keep you going when things are going difficulty and that's really important because behavior change is often difficult yes so people drop out we've seen before but if you set clear goals then you know all right let's hang in maybe I because I wanted to achieve this thing yes because if you have no goals and you don't abandon anything because you were not going anywhere anyway so it's less likely if you think all right this is not really helpful I don't like this move away it's nothing that sets you to all right that's what I want to go that keep going so the persistence helps you had to to prolong for trying to fight to get to this goal no so that helps the goal and um goal setting can also activate um that you have to do something because if the goal is very difficult you start really thinking about all right maybe I have to start coming up with new ways of doing this because it's new if I for example if we say we go to Mars or we go to another planet who that's not something I do every day I now really have to sit down and start thinking how the heck do I get to Mars yes so it also opens up the idea that you now have to reflect and think and start discovering ways of getting there yes so that is also helping if you set the goal um now enough talking about the mechanism another thing in the picture of the goal setting is the moderators so these are variables that can enhance the relationship between you set the goal and your performance okay so goal commitment the more people are committed to this goal the higher chances that they actually achieve it yes so commitment is important especially if it is difficult task if if you're not committed to say all right I'm gonna jump 20 times up and down I didn't like it I didn't want to do it anyway yes but if you really make commitment then it's better call importance how important is if I jump up and down 20 times if no one cares I don't care why should I do it yeah so if it says no my life depends on it now I will jump up and down 20 times yes so how important that is that helps now important can also be becoming an organization so if you uh for example commit publicly to something now it's it becomes also important because yeah otherwise people are looking at you you said you would want to do this uh so there's extra kind of motivation to do it uh but also maybe there's an inspiring vision that tells you like we want to go to mars because if we go to mars I don't know what the hell we want to do on mars but that's if you have a good vision why you have it's important yes then you will put the extra mile into it self-efficacy is another uh moderating factor the feeling that you can actually do this if you have a feeling that you can achieve this goal of jumping up and down 20 times well I will do it if I have no self-efficacy in this I think jumping up and down that's really difficult yes then I'm not gonna commit to this goal I'm not trying to even try to do it yes so here your leaders can help so they have to provide adequate training show role models that others can do it these kind of things and express confidence yes so our application could do this our application can tell you like I think you can do it I've seen it in the past that you were walking outside so you apparently already active maybe you can I think easily do a little bit more walking yes so showing confidence helps people to build their self-efficacy feedback is also another mechanism which strengthen the bond with setting goals and the performance you actually so having regular feedback how well are you on track to get your goals so if you have no idea are you on track there so you said so but you're done close right and walk around in the room that you don't know but if you hear yes you're going close you're moving left you have a right yes that I have feedback that I can adjust myself otherwise I stop at the yes closing eyes walking around here I just stop because I have no clue whether I get better or worse towards my goal yeah so giving people feedback helps them to become motivated to adjust task complexity the more complex the task is because we know the difficulty level is helping also to improve the things also require a higher skill set and strategies cannot be like London automatic pilot had a system one now people also have to start thinking now you need to be this means to be available this kind of ability to deal with this higher skill set if you have not then it's difficult but it also motivate people to start looking for this kind of extra skill set that they need so that is another kind of moderating factor so to summarize goal setting theories indicate by setting a goal which is very specific also a bit challenging it help people to motivate them and actually do it and so therefore you see it often in these kinds of interventions that in initially we started talking with the user about what they want to achieve and then it helps them to understand why they are doing it and also to motivate them to keep going okay I hope you enjoyed it and see you in the next video
