Summary of the Fox Behavior Model:

The Fox Behavior Model, designed by BJ Fogg, explains how behavior is influenced by three core elements: motivation, ability, and triggers. The model is visually represented with motivation on the vertical axis, ability on the horizontal axis, and the relationship with triggers depicted by a curve.

Key Components of the Fox Behavior Model:
- Motivation: Can range from very low to very high and refers to the desire to perform a specific action. Core motivators include pleasure vs. pain, hope vs. fear, and social acceptance vs. rejection.
- Ability: Refers to the ease with which someone can perform a given behavior. Factors influencing ability include time, money, physical effort, cognitive load (brain cycles), social deviance, and routine vs. non-routine.
- Triggers: Are cues that prompt action. They are effective when they are positioned above the model's action line, which indicates that a behavior is likely to occur. Triggers fall into three types:
  1. Spark: Motivates action.
  2. Facilitator: Makes action easier by reducing the barriers associated with ability.
  3. Signal: Serves as a reminder and is most effective when both motivation and ability are already high.

According to the model, for a behavior to occur, an individual needs to be sufficiently motivated, have the ability to perform the behavior, and experience a relevant trigger. The model is applied by positioning a task in relation to these factors to understand or predict behavior. When tasks are easy and motivation is high, behavior is likely. Conversely, when a task is hard and motivation is low, itâ€™s less likely a trigger will lead to action. Therefore, depending on the individual's motivation and ability, triggers must be designed accordingly to be effective.

In summary, the Fox Behavior Model is a practical framework for understanding what drives behavior and how to influence it through the appropriate use of triggers, considering an individual's motivation and ability.

Fox behavior model. In this video, I will explain the Fox behavior model. So afterwards you should be able to tell others how the Fox behavior model works. The behavior model is about what helps people to do certain things. What two important factors are there that help people to be motivated to do things. Let's look at the model of BJ Fock. We have seen it before when we were talking about BMAT. Which talks about motivation, ability and the trigger. Fox model is such a popular model because it is rather simple. Two dimensions and a trigger. The idea is on a horizontal plane we have the ability. Something is hard to do or something is very easy to do. Then practically we have motivation. We have a very low motivation doing it or we have a very high motivation to do it. Now you can position a task that you have. Is it a difficult thing to do? Easy to do? Is it something highly motivated or lowly motivated? Now you position your thing that you are asking. Now if you are positioned somewhere very up in the corner with hard and low motivation. Then what you need is a trigger. Something which sets off like alright I should do it. Now here you see this curve. And the curve is the kind of the line when triggers fall below that curve. It's unlikely to happen if they are positioned above the curve. They are likely to happen according to this idea, this model. So if they are very hard or people are very low in motivated. That's very difficult that when the trigger arise that says people should you want to do this? That's unlikely. Now if on the other hand you have the ability and maybe you are not that motivated. But you are motivated enough that when the trigger arise you are above this line you will do it. Now let's make it more concrete. So showering yes. Now my telephone rings. Okay should I pick it up or not? So the ringing is the trigger. So picking up the phone is in a sense quite easy to do I could say. Motivated now I'm showering. There's not the time for picking up the phone. So this would be then below the curve. It's still easy to do you could say. But I'm not motivated because I'm showering. And I'm not willing to talk to someone on the telephone when I'm showering. So here you see something going wrong. It's below the trigger. Even if it is easy. Another thing. Okay back to the marathon. I know it's very hard to do. And so I have little ability because I'm not a marathon runner. But maybe I'm so motivated to doing it. Then when there is someone inviting me to participate in. Let's do it together. I'm also trying to train for the marathon. Then I might actually jump to this chance. Because I'm highly motivated. Even if I don't have really the ability. Yes and I start motivating myself. Now things that we now learn from this thing. Is that we have two kinds of skills that we can see. Of course the best things are things that are very easy. And people that are highly motivated. However we can compensate. If people are highly motivated. They can do a little bit harder things. If they are very low motivated. Then we have to work hard to make the things very easy. Otherwise they will not do it. Still the third part that we learn from Fox Model. Is we need again a trigger. Something has to happen that people do it. Otherwise it's not going to happen. Okay now let's go back to the motivators. And the ability and the trigger. So core motivators is what Fox says are the three. Is the happy or pleasure and pain. That's a very core motivator. Or hope and fear or social acceptance or rejection. Yes so he's pushing us like consider those three. If you want to see how to motivate people. Abilities. So if you think about people's abilities. You have to think about several things. So he thinks about just six things which you look at. The ability in time. Do you have the time to do it now? Money. Do you have the money to do it now? Because maybe running the marathon you need a lot of shoes. And food and materials. Just to prepare yourself. Three physical effort. And do you have the energy to do the physical effort? The brain cycles. Is it too difficult? Is it a lot of calculation that you need or something? Social deviant. Are you doing something which is really different what your peer group is doing? Do you want to stand out and everyone looks at you? So that's also. And six. The ability is it non-routine? Hey remember if it is something routine system. One low energy. You can do this automatically with your eyes shut. However if it is something that you really have to think hard. It's not routine. Yes. Then it's difficult. It's no longer easy walk in the park stuff. Okay. Trigger. Trigger. FOC. More or less you see three types of triggers. So you have the spark. The facilitator. And the signal. So the sparks are triggers that also try to motivate you. Yes. So there's a message coming in. All right. You have only 20 minutes before the close stops. Or it is the last one before they run out of items to sell. Yes. So these are. Again it triggers something and it also motivates you to do something. Try to persuade him. The facilitators are focusing more on the ability. So here it's helping you things to do to make it easier for example. So I guess the famous example is always the Amazon click one click buy button. It makes it very easy. Like oh I want to buy. What you want to buy. Just press it. Done. Yes. So you make it very easy. So these triggers help to facilitate something. Now in some cases when you're already motivated and the task is easy. You only need a signal to set it off. Yes. So it serves often as a reminder like. All right. It's time to do the walking. Okay. Yeah. Thank you for reminding me. Otherwise I was forgotten about it. Yes. So think about it. Creating a spark. A facilitator or just a signal. All right. Wrap. Put it together. The summary. Yes. So Fox model. Two dimensions. The ability. The motivation. And in between you have the trigger. Yes. So you have to get on a position that you are above the line. The curve of the trigger. For a trigger to really to happen. That people actually doing the task or the things that you ask them to do. If the ability is too low or the motivation is low. You fall below that curve and the trigger fails in a sense. Okay. That's the theory that Fox put forward. I hope you enjoyed it.
