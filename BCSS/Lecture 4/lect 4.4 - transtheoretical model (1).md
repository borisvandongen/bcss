**Summary of Lecture: Trans-Theoretical Model of Behavior Change**

**Definition:**
The Trans-Theoretical Model (TTM) is a framework for understanding the stages of behavior change. TTM integrates several theories of behavior change with the aim to describe a person's readiness to adopt healthy behaviors.

**Stages of TTM:**
1. **Pre-contemplation**: Individuals have no intention to change behavior in the near future and may be unaware of the need for change.
2. **Contemplation**: Individuals acknowledge the possibility of change but are ambivalent and not yet ready to commit.
3. **Preparation**: Individuals are planning to take action soon and are mentally preparing for it.
4. **Action**: Individuals modify their behavior toward the desired change.
5. **Maintenance**: Individuals work to sustain the new behavior and avoid relapse.
6. **Termination**: (Not always recognized) Individuals have no temptation to return to old behavior and the new behavior is fully integrated.

**Behavior Change Techniques:**
- **Consciousness Raising**: Providing information to raise awareness of problem behavior.
- **Dramatic Relief**: Experiencing negative emotions attached to unhealthy behaviors.
- **Self-Reevaluation**: Reflecting on self-image with and without the problem behavior.
- **Environmental Reevaluation**: Realizing the negative impact of oneâ€™s behavior on others.
- **Self-Liberation**: Belief that one can change and committing to that belief.
- **Helping Relationships**: Seeking and receiving support from others.
- **Counter Conditioning**: Substituting healthy behaviors for unhealthy ones.
- **Reinforcement Management**: Increasing rewards for healthy behavior choices.
- **Stimulus Control**: Removing reminders or cues to engage in unhealthy behaviors.
- **Social Liberation**: Realizing that societal norms are changing to favor healthy behaviors.

**Application of TTM:**
Different techniques are applicable at different stages of TTM. As a person progresses through the stages, perceived pros of behavior change increase and cons decrease, and self-efficacy improves.

**Case Study:**
A research project aimed to help people with sleep problems failed when users showed ambivalence not only toward changing their sleep habits but also toward using the tool designed to assist them. This demonstrates a meta-level of ambivalence where individuals can be resistant even to interventions meant to facilitate change.

**Conclusion:**
The TTM outlines the various stages an individual passes through on the path to behavior change, including a pre-contemplation stage where the need for change is not recognized, up to a potential termination stage where the new behavior becomes automatic. Interventions should be targeted to the appropriate stage to be effective.

Trans-theoretical model. In this video I will explain the trans-theoretical model and afterwards you should be able to explain the different steps or phases as you might say people go through or you could identify people might be in when moving towards changing their behavior and ultimately make it a kind of a habit or routine. All right, so why the name trans-theoretical model? So the idea is there are several ideas about that people have different phases so the people who propose this model tried to have looked at all these different models and then say right a trans-model which more or less transcends the other models is here to explain these models. Okay so what are the stages and I'm not going to suggest that everyone has to go to those stages and you cannot go back and forward but it is important to recognize there are different stages people might be in. All right so the first one is the pre-contemplation, then the contemplation, the preparation, action and the maintenance. So pre-contemplation is that people are not even considering to change your behavior. Contemplation contemplating should they do it or not. Preparation all right now you prepare for the change coming that you want to do and action is really starting to change your behavior and maintenance is the phase where you try to maintain this change that you now have achieved. Okay now let's look at those stages one by one. Pre-contemplation so I said already the definition is at least that within six months you would not do any change concerning this so there's no intentions to do it. Then the reason might be that people are not aware or not informed that about the benefits of changing their behavior. So think again about smoking people might not be aware that it can increase lung diseases or what can also be the case is they try so often to quit they give up it doesn't work anymore so they demoralize to try to change their behavior. Now these are the pre-contemplation there's often the largest group of people if you consider changing people's behavior and this group also avoid reading they might know in the back of mind smoke is not good but try to ignore all this material because as we've seen by the cognitive dissonance theory that yes there are conflicting ideas there and one way is to deal with this just to ignore the information that points to this conflict or dissonance. Now this group is also often not motivated that's the point also and resistant to therapy or something or interventions. Contemplating now we move one shift up is that people might consider this change and according to the definition like within intended to maybe change in six months so people think I could see myself in six months starting to quit smoking or something. Now this phase often is characterized that people are ambivalent about yeah they could do it could stop smoking has these benefits but yeah on the other hand I also like smoking I don't see myself doing it so they don't know yet whether they want to go or not but they at least start considering pre-contemplation the address I want to keep on smoking there's no consideration what think about quitting. Here they are contemplating whether or not they want to change their behavior and now this is often a very long period yeah so here the definition is at least in six months but here you see people are very long in this phase chronic procrastination people refer to it but yet it's already one step that we can work with because people already consider it during it here you also have to consider that people are not yet action oriented yes where the next phase people start thinking all right what do I actually have to do to stop and quit with smoking or prepare for the running of the marathon yes so then they really start thinking about actions here is not yet there this is something that we see in the preparation phase now people move to all right within a window for something within 30 days I really think that I gonna commit to starting this changing this behavior here often you see really starting people to prepare themselves getting more information about things starting to draw up a plan and we think about the goal setting here also here you see people starting preparing for this and if you look at behavior change support systems or interventions these are where people are targeting because these are the people who start preparing so they're not trying to convince often people to start changing their behavior the intervention often target this kind of group but it's a much smaller group it's this kind of funnel again large people in the pre-contemplation contemplation preparation yeah so if you want to reach out to a larger group then you have to consider that they might be in a contemplation phase and there you have to try to convince them and move them to the preparation phase okay after this now they have the planning you have done it now they start really executing they start this change they start really changing they start quitting with smoking they start really preparing the marathon running every day you do a bit of running and this starting eating healthy these cancers now they are in the process of the change and okay and and you you see this change behavior that they do and within the six months period still yes after the six months in it we might start talking about okay maybe they maintain this new behavior so it's important to see so when people are in the action phase it's not that they will always be there so maybe they try for a couple of weeks to quit smoking but fall back and give up again yes so we still in this period where there's not yet a habit established yes so it needs longer so the definition here is six months before we start talking about okay the maintenance phase the maintenance phase we now talk about that we have created a habit we moved it from system two to system one in a sense now the elephant is taking over and here that the trick is of course is is to reward people that they're doing this develop that in their own kind of routine and prevent people to relapse back so maybe after a year they have been on the party again and start smoking again what can you do to all right maybe you go wrong but keep on ignoring smoking don't continue again so the relapsation plans are important there um then the termination phase sometime people say that is a kind of theoretical phase that you are now uh they're 100 percent you and this routine is always there and there's no risk that you will fall back in your own routine start smoking again or these kind of things um sometimes it's theoretical but all right it's interesting to have this phase as well um now throughout these phases you could have different techniques that you can use uh that helps you to move from the one phase to the other so here are a number and we go quickly to a couple of ideas that you have then what you can use uh in these different phases to move people forward so uh consciousness raising is very simple is helping people to learn new facts about the and become aware about the negative situation or in the benefits if they move and change their behavior yes uh dramatic relief um so have this um experience the the negative emotion of their unhealthy risk behavior so they know all right oh god i'm really not happy actually about the smoking and um and also what is the worries that you have yes so really feel what you actually might not be so happy about what the current maladaptive behavior is self reevaluation um realizing that a change is part of your identity yes so that you see this kind of changing behavior might be also part how you see yourself and it's important that we will see later on in the videos about your identity who is it that you think you you are you how do you look at yourself so if you now start incorporating this idea that to change the behavior that you want to change is part of your identity that can also help another trick is environmental reevaluation help to learn people to reevaluate the negative impact their current maladaptive behavior might have are they aware that smoking might impact their children maybe directly physically but also later and they give them bad a role model so the chances might be also that their children start uh smoking and their children i don't know yeah so and and the smoking itself could also be um unborn children yes all these kind of things that people start to realize that their emotion have an impact on their social environment that also helps them to see what do they um yeah appreciate the thing they are doing um now moving to the other side of the slide self-deliberation making a firm commitment to change yes so all right i've been doubting and thinking of whether i should do it but now i make a commitment so away all those doubts and second thoughts making a commitment so there's a self-liberation helping relationships yes so that's a technique that you try to support people who want to make a change yes create a kind of a social support around it peers family members friends they can help you and so that's another threat uh strategy a counter conditioning yes so we have seen this before substitute a kind of routine behavior that you have with something else so remember we talk about the cribs i'm hungry and then i eat chips change that for i'm hungry i'm eating fruit or something yes so you create a new condition or or a new you have the cue but now you put it in another action there that you normally have a reinforcement management yes so make sure that you increase the rewards that you get if you do the behavior that you want to do so create the rewards that for example if you quit smoking the reward could be the money that you're now being saving now give yourself this money to buy something fun yes so not smoking allows you to spend the money on something fun you like to do a stimulus control uh try to remove reminders about the old cue we have seen that before so move away your ashtrays these kind of things or um all the the the the the books that you might have about cooking unhealthy stuff remove that i only have the healthy cookbooks there social liberation um yeah realize that the social norms are changing so also that that helps so for something smoking it used to be a very common thing but realizing that a lot of people it's not a common thing anymore and that is quite some people frown up if you start smoking yes so to realize that that you were there but it's more acceptable now to start moving that direction this new behavior can also be very liberating now all these different uh changing strategies can be used at different times in the um if you look at TTM yes so in the pre-contemplation uh pre-contemplation uh what is it pre-pre-contemplation phase yeah these words so you could use their conscience raising environmental re-evaluation dramatic release social liberation so these are the things that you can use to shift people to contemplation because that is about being aware and seeing the negative things that you're currently doing and the impact it is having once you're in a contemplation you might focus on another strategy as a self-realization who am i uh what do i want to achieve where is my identity and once you move into the preparation and the action then you will the self-liberation liberation you set this goal you're now gonna commit to this and uh but now you start really doing the action now you need your social environment support environment so there's helping relationship and counter conditioning make sure that the other routine is pushed out so that all those cues are away so that you focus and are distracted on developing your new type of habit and once you start developing these actions and new routines using reinforcement managing these reward and stimulus control and you get away from all the other old cues now see you can use them at different points so sometimes it does not make sense to start using things when people are in a different phases no pointing start talking about reinforcing management when people are not even contemplating to change yes what this also gives this overview is that you see different changes over time so when you go from pre-contemplation to contemplation then people start to see the pros of this new changing behavior if you move further away they can see the cons of the changing is decreasing yeah so first they see all right there's benefits but there's still lots of effort i've made and when they get further into this chain they can see all right the effort is doable you can manage and then you see also when people prepare preparing or do the action the self-efficacy goes up because they know they can do it yes so you can see also over time how things change and that's important because people change over time and if you keep track on them then also your interaction your behavioral change system should also change with them because they have different concerns and different things that motivates them in different phases okay um then a quick example i want to talk about uh that we did some research again so i mentioned before already that we wanted to make an application that help people to uh with sleep problems but then we realized there's this huge group of people who are in the pre-contemplation not yet in the uh preparing phase so we thought maybe we should give them a tool where that can support them to think about it the pros and cons moving them out of this ambivalence part to the next phase so we had a very naive model initially we thought about the pre-contemplation this ambivalence is right do the experience and help a sleep problem if not all right no need to act in the sense do the intent to act that is thing and then start the treatment so that was the naive model we thought all right if we now give this tool that helps them to reflect on the situation then we're good because they then go quicker to all those steps we set out the experiment try to collect some data and we miserably failed in a sense very few people really use the tool because we asked them to do it a couple of times very a couple did it once but no one actually did it multiple times and then we start realizing if you look at ambivalence there's also an ambivalence about using certain tools yes so it's not only about do i have a sleep problem bit ambivalent about this do i want to consider to do something and it's also do i want to consider whether i want to consider doing something about it so it's a kind of a meta step and so considering using this tool you also should take into account so if you ask people try to motivate them say read this leaflet that explains a bit you also have to consider that people might be ambivalent about should i read the leaflet should i put time in it should i listen to your app to explain this whole thing so you also have that level of ambivalence yeah so it's not that easy you give information and people just take it on they might also you have to win their resistance should i put time in this to listen to information that helps me to make a decision whether i should move forward to changing my behavior okay now let's bring it back again at the end of this video so we had this trans-theoretical model which has several phases the pre-contemplation people are not yet considering to change are not aware that there is a problem and then when they start being come aware and considering well maybe i should do it this is not really in a healthy lifestyle contemplation pre-preparation is all right i now start to prepare for the behavior change i want to start with then the action phase where they actually move from preparation to start changing and then that takes a while before it becomes a habit and then if after like six months then we start talking about the maintenance phase now we hope that there is a routine established and then if real things are really wonderful then you have the termination phase that is you never have a relapse and it's completely automated all right i hope you enjoyed this video see you the next one
