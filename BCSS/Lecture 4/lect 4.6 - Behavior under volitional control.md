**Summary of Lecture on Volitional Control and Behavior Models**

Volitional control refers to behaviors that individuals consciously decide to engage in after rational deliberation. The lecture explores several models that seek to understand and predict how people decide to act or refrain from acting.

1. **Theory of Reasoned Action**:
   - Developed to understand the relationship between attitudes and behaviors.
   - Suggests that the best predictor of behavior is the intention to perform it.
   - Intention is influenced by:
     - Attitude towards the behavior (is it viewed positively or negatively?).
     - Subjective norms (what do significant others think one should do?).

2. **Theory of Planned Behavior**:
   - An extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action.
   - Adds perceived behavioral control to the equation, acknowledging the role of one's perceived ability to perform the behavior.

3. **Technology Acceptance Models (TAM)**:
   - Developed to understand the adoption of technology.
   - Suggests that perceived usefulness and ease of use influence attitudes toward technology, which in turn determine the intention to use it.

4. **Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)**:
   - An expanded model inclusive of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influences, and facilitating conditions.

5. **UTAUT 2**:
   - A further expansion that includes hedonic motivation (emotional pleasure), price value, and habits.

The lecture concludes that understanding intention—shaped by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control—is key to predicting behavior. It further emphasizes that for technology-related behaviors, usability, usefulness, social influences, and external conditions must be considered. These models are continually updated as new research findings emerge.

**Important Definitions**:
- **Behavior under Volitional Control**: Actions that an individual decides to take after thoughtful consideration.
- **Attitude**: An individual’s positive or negative evaluation of performing a behavior.
- **Subjective Norms**: Belief about whether people important to the individual think he or she should engage in the behavior.
- **Perceived Behavioral Control**: Belief in one's ability to perform a behavior.
- **Perceived Usefulness**: The degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance.
- **Perceived Ease of Use**: The degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort.
- **Performance Expectancy**: The degree to which an individual believes that using the system will help them to attain gains in job performance.
- **Effort Expectancy**: The degree of ease associated with the use of the system.
- **Social Influences**: The degree to which an individual perceives that important others believe he or she should use the new system.
- **Facilitating Conditions**: The degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists to support the use of the system.

Students are encouraged to apply these models to understand behavior in a variety of domains, including health behaviors and technology acceptance.

Behaviour under volational control. In this video I want to look at behaviours that people can think about, take a rational decision about. And I want to look at models that can explain or predict how people will, what kind of actions they will take or will not take. So, we start with the theory of recent action. Then we move on to a little bit newer theory, the theory of planned behaviour. And these two are generic theories about people's behaviour. And then we move, use these theories for technology. The first one is the technology acceptance models. And then the more recent one is the unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology. And why we want to look at this is the first two models give us again some handles how to motivate people, what factors are determining whether people will do a certain behaviour. The last two theories we can use to understand whether people accept and start using technology. And which is important if we make behaviour change support systems. What factors are influencing that people start using these kinds of technologies. Okay, now let's start with attitude. And that's quite an interesting anecdote in the past. So, in the past, people thought if you know people's attitude, you can predict what kind of behaviour they will do. And so a lot of research went into attitude. But then there was one interesting important study. It's Richard Lapierre, who went around in America in the 1930s with a Chinese student. So at that time, Chinese students or Chinese population were discriminated in the US. And so it was interesting what his experience. So what he did, he went with the student and his wife. I guess he did some touring around for his academic work. So he went to 66 hotels, auto campers and tourist homes. And he was only once refused to bring along his Chinese student during all those occasions. And which was a bit puzzling because he knew that there was this resistance against the Chinese population in China. But when he just asked people, can I bring along here my student, can the student can also sleep here? There was only one establishment who would refuse. And he also went to restaurants, so 184 restaurants and throughout the US in the 1930s. So six months later, when he completed this whole tour around, he mailed all these establishments asking whether they would accept someone of the Chinese race into their establishment. And then if I see correctly, 92 would say no, we would not serve people from a Chinese background. Now you see what the puzzling thing this academic had. First, of course, it's like, what's the problem? Why all the Chinese people? Why not accepting? But put that aside, the academic question, of course, is your attitude. You're indicating this questionnaires that you definitely will not do it. But when I was there with my Chinese student and my wife, you allowed me to come in. So there's a big distinction between the actual behavior and the attitude. OK, so this started research into how well can attitude actually predict behavior? So one of the important theories there is the theory of reasoned action. There's a theory which explains how or the factors that influence people to take a certain action. Now, on the one side, you see the action and the best predictor they see of this behavior is the intention to do the behavior. So the intention to would I accept or let's let's put it quitting with smoking again. It's a better prediction if you say, all right, if you make it very concrete and actionable. So is it I would quit smoking in two weeks is a good predictor of people who actually start quitting with smoking. Then something the general attitude about smoking. This intention, if you look at the theory, is influenced by two major things. So it's the attitude towards that behavior. So that behavior of quitting with smoking, very concrete. And the subjective norm and subjective norm in this case is what do I think other people who are important to me think what I should do? So is my mother thinking that I should quit smoking? Is my partner think that I should quit smoking? So this is a kind of the subjective social norm. And that is also a good predictor, according to this model of people's behavioral intention. Then you go further up the line, you could break this up, this attitude again about the belief that the behavior will lead to a certain outcome. And how the people evaluate that outcome. So if you say, if I quit smoking, how likely is it that I develop this lung disease? And so how likely is that? And how important is it for me not to have a lung disease? So these are different things that you have to combine together. Now, multiple elements, so a fresh breath, more feeling, more energy. So these are all kinds of positive things that you can relate to quitting with smoking and the evaluation of like having a fresh breath, having more energy, less chance of lung diseases. Now, these have to be evaluated and taken together. That forms an attitude. Now, the same you can say for the beliefs, for the social norms of the subjective norm. Sorry, that so what do you think relevant to other people's think that you should do and how much are you motivated to comply with these particular individuals? So maybe I don't care much about what my boss is saying, but in some cases I might really find it important to listen to him or her. And yes, these factors, again, are all, again, influenced by external variables. You could say this are by demographic variables, so age, gender, occupation, but also attitude towards the target in general, towards the people or healthy or lifestyle or institutes. So maybe it's a doctor saying how normally do I listen to the doctor? And there could also be a personality traits, extroversive, introversive. Now, these could all influence these other factors. Now, together, this is the theory of recent action. So two important things and what you can take from it. If you make a behavior change support system, yes, if you want to think about the intention, that's a good predictor. But then you have to think about these intentions. How are they influenced? So attitude. So how do people stand against this or view these intentions? And also, what do they think other people think about what they should do in this situation? The subjective norm. So let's go through them one by one. Again, attitude we talked already about with an example, the belief that if I diet, I will lose weight. Sporting will give me more energy. Supporting me using the sleep care app will make me sleep better. And the evaluation. So how much do I like losing weight? Is sleeping important to me? Now, these are other examples that we talked already before. Subjective norm. Again, my family thinks I should diet. If my friend thinks I should losing weight. Is it important for my partner that I got enough sleep? And how important is my partner, my family, my friends, that I listen to them and their opinions? And then the intentions, really concrete, towards the behavior. So intent to start a diet, intent to go to gym next week, intent to using the sleep care app, for example, to monitor my sleep. Yes. So if you want to make the prediction, you have to make this intention very concrete of the behavior that it tries to predict. Now, moving on to the next theory, the theory of planned behavior. In a sense, an extension of the previous theory. The only thing what you add to this is the perceived behavioral control and the control's belief. As the developers, Fisbeiner and Eijend already realized that it's also important to look at how capable people feel that they control the behavior. Health efficacy, another word for it. So do they feel that they can do it? So maybe I have a positive attitude on my friends and family members think I should do it, but if I don't feel capable of doing it, I'm also not doing it. So that is an added thing in the theory of planned behavior. And there's some extra control about where from intention, you might still have the intention, but you have the environment against you to really implement. So you might want to start running around for physical activity, but for some reason you have to stay indoors and you're not allowed to go outside. This could, again, hinder your intention to move to a behavior. Now, we mentioned already the control believed and the perceived behavioral control and the overall question is still the same. Now, these kind of are all kinds of generic theories that you can stick on all kinds of behaviors. Now, work has also been done on specifically using this theory to explain whether people start using a technology. So the behavior there is what intention is there, would people use this application? So initially they started with applications such as typewriters, word processors. It's very simple, kind of task oriented task application that supports you. Now, here they propose the technology acceptance models. And you could see still a bit from the original theory in it, where you see there's still the attitude there that predicts the behavioral intention. And the attitude is predicted by two important key components is the perceived usefulness and the perceived ease of use. So how useful is it to use the text writer to create a new letter? And how easy is it to use the text writer, the word processor to write it? So they saw that as two determining factors. Now, lots of work is being done on this. I think that's one of, if you look at the information system field, this is one of the most dominant theories. And now they moved on from the technology acceptance model to the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. And here they extended the model. And instead of talking about perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, they now start talking about the performance expectancy, the effort expectancy. So that's basically the same. You can see the usability and the usefulness. But now they also brought back social norms, subjective norms. See, social influences now in the model and the facilitating condition. And we talked about it before. It's the environment opening and helping you to allow you to exhibit this behavior. And across all these kinds of lines, you could say impacting factors, demographic things like gender, age, experience and voluntariness of use. So do you have to use this thing or can you make a decision that you have to use? Is the whole company going for Microsoft Office or is a room that you can choose something for yourself? Now, that determines also whether you have a voluntary decision or not. Now, we have also been using this model in our research. And the research that we were trying to do is renal transplant patients, whether they accept self-management support systems. So renal transplant papers have the kidney transplant. And if they're at home, they have to monitor their own health. So would they want to accept such a system that's supporting them? So we use this model and ask people about what they expect the performance to be, to improve it, how much effort that it will take. And what we also added in our model was the effect, the emotional part of using such a system and the trust. Now, after four months using this, we put out this questionnaire and asked them and then we saw which one is the best predictor of the behavioral intention. And we found two when we run this as part also in a random control trial. And there we definitely saw that the effort expectancy, effect and trust were correlating with people's behavioral intention. Now, of course, there are some notes there to make that others might not correlate, because in a trial, you already ask people whether you want to use it. Yes, because otherwise they won't go into the trial. Ethically, it should be voluntary. So maybe they already decided beforehand that the performance expectancy that they thought they will get something out of this. And when people thought, all right, the system is not helping me anyway, they would not sign up for such a trial. So that might be a bit biased of the result. But interesting already to see that also in this kind of system support, that try to support people to change their behavior in doing self-med at home, such a model can also be helpful to see what is influenced their intention. And interesting here is also the effect to the emotional part, whether people enjoy it, had pleasure, found it interesting to use it, and it gives them a bit of joy, is also important when you think about behavioral change systems. Yeah, so also using the system should also not be frustrating, another way of putting it. Recently, unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology got an update. Now we have version two, which have a couple of more of factors. So you have now the hedonic motivation. So that's also the emotion has now also be included in the larger model. And the price value. So how much does it cost in a sense? And habits are now also included. And we've seen that habits, system one, is a major impact in people's decision making and behavior. So this model is being extended, and I'm sure that over a couple of years, this model again is being extended, because lots of research is being done on this model. Okay, now to wrap up this video, we looked at different kinds of models, which try to explain which factors can predict people's behavior. So we started with the theory of recent action, and where we saw this attitude, and the subjective norm, then with theory of planned behavior, added with the perceived... Oh, this is really small, I have to really lean for behavioral control. Self-efficacy, I always remember this. Then we have the two specific models for technology acceptance. So the technology acceptance models, where perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were important. Then we have the factors of the attitude, and the attitude again to the behavioral intention to use the technology, which predict again where the people actually start using your application. And this has grown out now to a larger theory, of a unified theory of acceptance and the use of technology. Okay, so that was it for this video. See you in the next one!
