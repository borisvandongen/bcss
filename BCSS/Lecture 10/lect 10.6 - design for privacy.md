**Summary of Information Privacy in Behavior Change Support Systems**

**Key Topic**: Information Privacy and its Importance

- Collecting data in behavior change support systems is crucial for personalization and motivation.
- With data collection comes the responsibility to handle the data sensibly and legally, as illustrated by regulations like the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Definition**: 
Information Privacy: The right of individuals, groups, or institutions to decide when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.

- Mistakes in privacy can be indicators that other aspects of a product may not be well-thought-out.
- Data collected for a primary task can sometimes be misused in other contexts (e.g., a store using body size data for purposes other than helping customers find the right clothing size).

**Design and Privacy Principles** (drawn from the literature):

1. **Privacy First**: Consider privacy at the outset of designing a system, not as an afterthought. Be aware of regulations.
   
2. **What Can Go Wrong?**: Preemptively consider the potential misuse of data and mitigate risks.

3. **Minimal Data Collection**: Collect the least amount of data for the least amount of time necessary for the purpose.

4. **Protect the Data**: Securely store and encrypt data to prevent unauthorized access.

5. **Identity Management**: Assess the necessity of collecting real names and consider allowing pseudonyms or anonymous usage.

6. **Transparency**: Clearly explain how data is collected and used to enable users to understand and react if there's a problem.

7. **User Control**: Let users have a say in the design and settings of the application to control the use and storage of their data.

8. **Value-Conscious Design**: Engineers should recognize that technology impacts society and should integrate values important to users and themselves into the design.

- Technology and applications are not neutral; they can disrupt industries and societies (e.g., Facebook, Uber, Airbnb).

**Wrap-Up**:
The video concludes with an encouragement for viewers to become aware of information privacy issues and to refer to other guidelines such as ethical guidelines, trustworthy AI, and FAIR data sharing principles in research and development.

The summary presented emphasizes the importance of considering the privacy and security of user data from the beginning of system design, understanding both the legal obligations and ethical considerations in handling personal information.

## Transcript

In this video, we will look at key concepts related to information privacy. The reason I think we should look at this in a course like behavior change support systems is there's so much data that we collect. And we use, for example, to personalize or motivate people. But collecting this information comes with a responsibility. Collecting this information comes with the responsibility to do this also in a sensible and reliable way. And therefore, I think as part of the things we talked about the domain of cybersecurity, I thought let's also dive into privacy and information privacy. And that such a thing is important and get lots of attention recently is also because of the European General Data Protection Regulations. Now, let's look at information privacy. And I looked up a definition and let's read it here. Information privacy, the claim of an individual's group or institute to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about them is communicated to others. Yes. So the communication of information about you, who can do that and who has control about that. And often if there is something wrong with the privacy in a product, it often is an indicator that other things might also haven't been thought out well. Now, what is another problem with privacy is often then when attention is struck, people make decisions for sharing information about the primary task they are doing, but forget that the information that you share can also be used in another way. Yeah. The example, you go online and buy clothes and then you might enter your body size because then you can find the right T-shirt. But the owner of the shop can use this information because now he has an idea about your shape and might actually also again sell this information to other parties. Yeah. So now it becomes interesting. How do you make sure that you have this conflict of this information that people share because of a certain reason, but not allowing the person who, the company now to use this information in another manner. Another example is social networking where you might share photos, but the platform itself now also have your private pictures. Yes. Another thing to concern, think about. Okay. Now, I'm not going to look at in detail the general data protection regulation. I'm not a legal expert. So I look more at the design and privacy design principles. And Shep has written a nice little book about it. And a couple of principles there, which I think makes a lot of sense if you look at it. So first of all is privacy first. When you design a system early on, think about the privacy. Yes. Don't see it as an add-on at the end. Oops, let's do a little bit security and then everything is solved. No. At the beginning already, when you develop a system which collects data, think about the privacy rules. Yes. And be aware of those regulations. Yes. Because if you don't follow it, you could be in serious problems because yes, you violated the law. What can go wrong? That's another principle. Think about it early on. What if? What if the data I've collected with my behavior change support system is given and adopted health insurance? Or with a potentially new employer? Or a stalker? Or some criminals? So think about it. What if? Which then also puts you into mind how you can protect the person using your application that this information is ending up in the wrong hands. And also, where do you want to collect all this information? This moves to the principle of minimal data collection. In the past, people were always thinking like, all right, let's collect as many amounts of data. And then we have always all possibilities to do and things. That's a very risky strategy. Yes. Because if things go wrong, all this information might be ended up in the wrong hands. Yes. So the strategy, therefore, is only select the minimum amount of data that you actually need and have permission for. Yes. So minimum the amount of information that you need, but also for the minimum amount of time. You don't need the data maybe for 20 years to be stored. So destroy it when you don't need it anymore. That's also a security principle. Now, protect the data. Think, where is the data access stored? Lots of applications now work in the cloud. But what does it actually mean in the cloud? It's someone else's computer. Who has access to this computer? Who's maintaining this computer? Yes. So think about storing and encrypting this data. So then even if someone else has the access, it's still encrypted. Now, think about it when you store things in virtual cloud environments. The identity. Do users need to reveal their identity in your application? Lots of applications, people ask, type in your name. Is it really needed that people type in their name? There could be good reasons that people don't want to give their name or give away their identity. So if it's really necessary that people should have a name in your application or could they just come up with another name? Think about it, because you create, again, a risk there by asking people to identify themselves. Often, the problem also with data collection is you don't know what is happening with your data. So be transparent. Explain why the application is collected and what will be done with it, with this application. So it helps also the user to understand, oh, if something is wrong because they can understand what the system is supposed to do with it. And if they see it's doing something else, they know the system is wrong and then they can intervene. Otherwise, if there's a blackboard, they don't know what's happening with their data. Another strategy is to allow users to become the designer of their application. So to adapt their application to their situation, which then indicates what information your system is allowed to use or store. Allow people to set these kinds of things. And also, some engineers sometimes think, yes, but I'm just the engineer. It's a thing, not my issue. That's maybe something for a legal team, but that's not true. Yes, technology is not neutral. All these applications that we as engineers build have an impact on society. Yes, they are not neutral. So early on, think about the values that are important for the users and also the values that you find important as a designer to be projected into the world. Think again. Yes, so I've here put down a couple of these logos of companies and you see that they're not neutral. Facebook, is it just people sharing photos of each other? Or is it capable of also changing opinions and influence people? Uber, yes. Is it just a service that people can get a car and go from A to B? Or is it also disrupting the cab industry? Airbnb, is it just a service that people can say, all right, you can use my house for a couple of days? Or is it changing whole streets where tourists come and go and the regular people living there all of a sudden find their whole neighborhood being changed? Yes, so again, have an understanding what your application could have an impact in society. Okay, so with this video, I try to have put you a bit of an idea to become aware of the kind of information and privacy issues. And we looked at these eight principles, but be aware there are also other guidelines. So guidelines about ethical guidelines, right, trustworthy of artificial intelligence, also a series of things you have to consider, and especially relevant for us, because you could see that behavior change support system, but you can also use the AI technology in it. Also think about FAIR, the guidelines for dating, sharing data for scientists and stewardship about it. Now, I hope you enjoyed it and become a bit more aware of all these policies that you also have to take into account. See you in the next video.
