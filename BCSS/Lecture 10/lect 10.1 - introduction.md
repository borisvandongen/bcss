Summary:

In Lecture 9, titled "Application in eHealth and Cybersecurity," the focus is on behavior change support systems within two specific domains: eHealth and Cybersecurity. 

Key Takeaways:
1. eHealth:
   - The lecture includes examples from the professor's research on building behavior change support systems.
   - Students will learn about self-monitoring and self-management in the context of health, particularly within a home setting.
   - Cooperative Behavioral Therapy (CBT), often used in mental health treatments, will be discussed along with its applications in eHealth.

2. Cybersecurity:
   - The lecture extends the principles of persuasive technology to Cybersecurity.
   - Discussion points include data privacy and the use of protection motivation theory in Cybersecurity.

Objective:
- Students should be able to explain self-monitoring and self-management techniques in eHealth.
- Students will understand the application of CBT in eHealth.
- Students will gain insight into how persuasive technology principles apply to Cybersecurity, especially concerning data privacy and protection motivation.

The lecture aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of behavior change support systems and their implementation in two important and distinct fields, showcasing the versatility of persuasive technology.

## Transcript

Lecture 9, Application in eHealth and Cybersecurity In this lecture, we're going to look at behavior change support systems, but more in two domains. One is eHealth, the other Cybersecurity. And specifically in the eHealth domain, I'm going to look at my own research over the years and show a number of examples where we built these systems and did research there. So after this lecture, you should be able to explain a number of key concepts in eHealth when it comes to self-monitoring, self-management at home. Also, I want to look at two applications where we use co-operative behavioral therapy. That's a concept that you will see often when it comes to treatment related to mental health. After these topics, I want to move to another domain and show that all these things that we have been discussing about persuasive technology can also be used in another domain. And the domain I picked is Cybersecurity. There we will look also at data privacy, but also how you can use protection and motivation theory, for example, in the domain of Cybersecurity. I hope you will enjoy it and see you in the next video.
