### Lecture Summary: Conversational Agents in PTSD Therapy

**Topic:** The lecture addresses the use of conversational agents for online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in the context of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) therapy.

**Goals:**
1. Understand how to create motivational messages for a patient undergoing CBT for PTSD, particularly when treatment is challenging.
2. Learn how a system can identify when it's not working and motivate patients to seek human care.

**Key Definitions:**
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** A psychological treatment that helps individuals identify and change destructive or disturbing thought patterns that have a negative influence on behavior.

**Motivational Messages:**
- The treatment involves creating motivational messages to encourage patients to continue therapy, particularly when symptoms may initially increase before decreasing.
- Psychologists provided motivational texts for various scenarios to create a text corpus.
- Key variables for motivation include treatment progress (symptoms increasing, stable, or decreasing) and trust in the treatment's success.
- Logistic regression was used to predict which elements should be in a message, considering these key variables.
- The algorithm determines the inclusion of empathy, symptom awareness, and motivation within the messages.

**Experiment on CBT:**
- The study tested whether personalized messages based on treatment progress and trust levels could motivate patients more than general messages or no messages.
- Three independent variables: message type (personalized, general, none), treatment progress (rising, stable, dropping), and trust (low, doubtful, high).
- Three dependent variables: motivational change, trust in outcome, and feeling of being heard.
- Results showed personalized messages significantly improved motivation, particularly in scenarios where trust was high but symptoms were rising.

**Motivation to Seek Human Care:**
- Different stances (negative, doubtful, positive) and severities (severe, not severe) were considered for scaling up to human care.
- The approach includes accepting rejection when the problem is not severe, persuading when there is a severe issue, and facilitating when individuals are positive about seeking help.
- An algorithm was created to guide the system's response based on these variables.

**Experiment Findings:**
- Results highlighted that when patients are positive about seeking help, simply facilitating the process works well.
- In cases where patients are doubtful or negative but the situation is severe, persuasive messages are more effective.
- Acceptance did not work as expected in some cases, suggesting that even when severity is questionable, persuasion might still be beneficial.

**Closing Remarks:**
- Personalization of motivational messages to the patient's situation can improve the effectiveness of therapy.
- Adapting the strategy for motivating patients to seek human care based on their stance toward treatment can also be helpful.

**Conclusion:** The use of conversational agents for supporting patients with PTSD via online CBT can be enhanced through personalized motivational messages, which take into account the patient's progress and trust in the therapy. These agents can also play a role in guiding patients to seek human care when necessary. The research included analysis of psychologists' input, an understanding of the patient's stance, and the severity of symptoms, thus tailoring interactions to encourage continued treatment or seek additional help.

Conversational agents in post-traumatic stress disorder therapy. This video, I will look at the next piece of research that we have done together with people from Erasmus University and Amsterdam University. And here we look at, in this video, at how we can use CBT, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, online and in the context of PTSD. So after this, I hope that you have a bit of an understanding how we create motivational messages which an agent could say to a person halfway the treatment, when the treatment is going well or not that well, to motivate them to continue. Another point that we also will look at in this video is motivation to seek human care. So when the system recognizes it's not working, I think it should persuade the person to seek professional help from a human. Okay, now let's start with the motivational messages to continue the therapy. The software code and the paper itself is online available. So here you have the code which you can connect to it. But let's look at the motivational messages. So what we want to do is, how could we motivate a patient at home, working with the application, when halfway through the therapy, it might not go that well, yes? What you normally would expect, can expect with PTSD, is during the treatment, symptoms might actually go up and later go down. Now that might be a hard sell, because if you're doing the treatment, you hope that your symptoms reduce. So how do you motivate people to say, yes, that's expected to continue? What we did, our strategies was like this. We asked a large number of psychologists to write these motivational texts for different situations and we used that to create a text corpus. Then we used this text corpus to analyze, all right, what elements have been set and then use parameters about the trust people had in the therapy and the health situation to predict which elements of a message should be in it. And that we use it to stick together the message, the motivational message. Now let's go through that whole process step by step. Okay, so the two parameters I mentioned already is the treatment progress and the trust in success of the treatment. That's what we use. We thought that are the key variables for motivation to know. So is the treatment, you're halfway, 12 sessions you have in this treatment and halfway around treatment session eight or seven, is it going up? Meaning your symptoms increase. Are they stable? So nothing is happening. Or is it reducing? Right, it seems you're going on the right track. Now trust in it, depending, independent or whether it's going up, down or increases, patients might have trust in a good outcome, a bit doubtful or a bit worried about it, which also could be an impact of influence factor if people would continue. Now these two factors we took and we asked those psychologists to look at these different scenarios. So for example, treatment, high trust, but increasing number of symptoms. Now what would you write down? We collected this data and from 13 psychologists and here you see a number of things they wrote down. So for example, keep going, you are on the right track and probably notice that you are making progress. This troubles me, all right. You are on the right track. Your complaints follow a caparious course. Sometimes they decrease and after that they increase again or decrease, increase, sorry. You can assume that the complaints will reduce as you will progress working out the following memories. Yes. So you see all kinds of slightly different, different things they wrote down and a lot of text. Now here, what we did, we analyzed them, the blocks in it. What are the things? This is the work of Mirtha Thielman, her PhD work. So here, what we noticed there. So empathy, lots of elements of empathy was written down. You could clearly see, noticing the PTCL level, so symptoms going up or down, motivation in the text, complimented, good luck, go on like this, these kinds of things. And note also the trust people had, questions they may have, future about the up and downs and some general other information like tips and perspective. Now, what we then did is, all right, start labeling all those pieces of text. And we then use a logistic regression to indicate it. Now let's look at those sentence before I kind of talk about those logistic regressions. I was a bit ahead of myself. Is here you have a couple of sentences. I see you indicate that your complaints have gotten substantially worse. So that element is an example of noticing the rise in the PCL. I'm sorry to hear that. So here you have an example of empathy. However, it's always hard to work before we see any results. So it's giving perspective. And hold on. So motivation to hold on. Now you can see that's what we went through the text and keep these labels to the specifics part in the text that linked with these kinds of labels. Okay. Now, I mentioned already logistic regression, which says indicate like, should this part of the sentence be in or out given the two parameters based on the progress of the treatment going up, stable or down, or the trust in the outcome. And we have two steps in the algorithm. First, is it a supertype? You saw someone, there are some supertypes with types below it. Yes. If it is a 0.5, so 0.5 or higher says, right, it should be in it, was the prediction then. Okay. Then check whether the subtypes also had a chance of 0.5 or higher. If so, include it. If not, then pick one of the subtypes, otherwise everything. And if it was not a supertype, then include the statement. And step two, we picked more statements if needed, if we only had very few. Okay. Now, here you see some generation now, because now with this corpus, we could, and this algorithm, each time could generate new sentences based on basically hustling the old sentences, what we call of those 13 psychologists. Okay. Now, we also put it out in an experiment, do those personalized sentences, depending on those two parameters, actually motivate people. Now, what we did, we ran an experiment and here you could see the avatar that was talking to you, would say these things. And we wanted to know whether this works. So we had three independent measures, things that we were interested in. So the measured types. So we had this personalized type of message, or we gave a general message, which we had some general message. And then we asked also the psychologist, could you write a message, a motivation message on which, when you don't know whether the symptoms are going up or down, people have trust, what would you write in general? So this we also used. And we also had one condition with none, we didn't give any motivational message. Then the treatment progress, going up, down, and stable, and the trust, low, doubtful, or high. Now, that's what we manipulated. And then we measure three measures. The motivational change, would people feel more motivated to continue? Did they trust the outcome? And important, feeling of being heard. Now, we run this on Amazon, for crowd source experiments, you can run that with 207 participants who are non-patients, remember that, it's important. And these are the results, yes. So they were confronted with the personalized, or in generalize, or no motivation. And here you see the nine conditions. You see on the top, the rising, stable, or dropping of the symptoms, rising is worse, dropping, it became better. And here you see low trust, doubtful, or high trust. Now, I want to specifically focus on the corner, which is doubtful and high trust, and the rising of the PCL. So when things go worse. And here you could definitely see the red bar, which is the personalized messages are much better on how people interpret it. And this is the improvement score. So are they more motivated? Yes. And in this case, when the personalized measures are much more motivated than a generalized statement, or non-motivated. Okay, let's now ask another question that we did in that experiment. Because we were thinking, we make this standalone application people use at home, but what happens if the system noticed that the things are going better, worse, and worse, and worse, then they start realizing, all right, it's not going good. They should see a therapist, for example. Now, this situation is not that uncommon because online you have websites where you can get information and there's all anonymous and there's no person there. But at some point, the system might realize that, hmm, it's not going good. A person should see a professional, and then you should motivate the person, yeah? So how should the system go about it? Now, in this piece of work, we thought about a kind of a generic protocol, how to do this. And there, we thought about a different situation. So you have the stance of the person for scaling up, let's call it that, going for seeking help for a human. Are they negative? I don't want to go to a human, or maybe I should, doubtful or positive, yes, I like to talk to a human. And the situation, yes? Is it severe? Does it really require this attention, or, hmm, yes? Now, depending on this, you combine it, and we had basically two routes for the system to react. So one was to accept rejection, so accept in the case that it's not really severe, the problem, and people are a bit negative. Just accept that, because maybe if you are too harsh and try to push them to go for help, they might reject the system as a whole. And when it's a really serious problem, they will not come to the system and say, yes, this system is always just pushing me to do something, yes? So in that case, when people are a bit hesitant, and it was not severe, then you would just accept it for the moment. But point out, if they were interested, you could find help there, so that was that. In the other case, where there was doubt, and they might be interested, you could start persuading people. And the last one, facilitate, where people just say, yes, I want to talk to a person. All right, then just tell them where they can look for help. Now, this, in this matrix, you can see the particular hypothesis that we had. Yes, I mentioned them actually already. So we had three DICS distinctions. So the green one was the positive. If people were positive about scaling up, then the idea was, you just have to tell them. You don't have to convince them, just tell them where to find, to facilitate the seeking for help. And then on the top, we have the red one, where they are doubtful or negative, but we are severe or negative, then their tactic is to persuade. Yes, tell people, why are you not going there? Maybe, what are your problems? Oh, you can solve them this way or that way, or it might be helpful. Yes, now you start trying to persuade them to move their initial idea that they might be doubtful for looking for help. Now, the blue one, where they are negative stance, and it's also doubtful whether the severity is a real problem, then you accept the situation. Yes, you just point, there could be some help there if you're interested, but you don't try to persuade them. All right, now we implement it again, run this on Amazon Turk, this experiment, virtual coach, you had a chat communication, and depending on the situation, in this case, it was about seeking help if you have sleep problems, then we try to persuade or not, or accept, depending on your stance. Before that phase, before the experiment, we ask people whether, how much, what we could stop them, for example, if it was very expensive, we ask them, what do you find expensive? Now, then we know, all right, in this case, we'd say, all right, if 100 euro is very expensive, then we say, all right, there's 100 euro or 200 euro, meaning that they would be very reluctant to seeking help, or you'd say, oh, that's for free, then we know that this barrier was not there, and they were not so reluctant to see hacks, so that's why we manipulated this motivation to seek help in this experiment. Okay, now, the results, so here you see the results, three measures, the intention to seek help, the ISC, and then the intention to contact an agent again, do they come back, and that's what we wanted to know, if people, we will accept the situation, would they then come back to this, that's what we hope, and feeling of being heard, and that the idea is that you are in a certain situation, and that the system acknowledges that, and also pay attention to that. Okay, now, we had the different stance, people are negative, doubtful, or positive for seeking help, and here, the health situation, severe, negative, or doubtful. Green, red, and blue again, now, let's take the green one, the good news here is, if people are positive, and you could see, then whatever you do in a sense, they will look for everything, for seeking help, contact again, and feeling being heard, so just facilitating the green bar seems to be doing quite well, yes, and you don't, persuading all can also be good or accept, except not always good, but green seems to be working, so the message there is, yes, if you understand that people want to seek help, you don't need to persuade them, just facilitate it. And the red part, that was the part of persuasion, now, the middle cell, you can definitely see when people are a bit negative, and doubtful, here, persuasive messages compare, works much better than just accept and facilitate, yes. Now, the blue one in the corner, that is a bit not what we expected, because there we expected that the accept, the blue bar, would be the highest, but you clearly see that persuasion, for example, in the very negative, as people's stance was, was still better. This could mean that the whole idea of accepting might not be working, or it might be that we were thinking about the data, this were non-patients, and maybe they thought, right, it's severe, you should convince me still a little bit, yes, so we're not sure whether it's an artifact of the data, or our hypothesis is not really working, but as research, you not always get what you want, and that's how you learn. Okay, closing remark. So, motivational messages, you could adopt it to the situation, yes, so if people halfway, if you adopt it to the situation, you will see this little personalization, but adopting means to the situation, in this case, could help. Motivation to seek human care, again, adopting it to the situation might help. I hope you enjoyed this video, and I see you in the next one.
