### Summary of Lecture on Mindspace in Cybersecurity

**Mindspace Model Overview:**
- The Mindspace model is an acronym standing for Messenger, Incentive, Norms, Defaults, Salience, Priming, Affect, Commitment, and Ego.
- Developed and used by the UK Cabinet Office during Tony Blairâ€™s tenure, the Mindspace model is focused on influencing behaviors, particularly in the domain of cybersecurity.
- Mindspace focuses primarily on 'System 1' thinking, which is automatic, fast, and often subconscious.

**Key Components:**
1. **Messenger:** Trust in the individual or entity that communicates cybersecurity information can affect compliance.
2. **Incentive:** Rewards and punishments can influence behavior, but the effectiveness depends on timely and reliable enforcement and appropriate severity.
3. **Norms:** Organizational cybersecurity culture and what is considered normal behavior can impact individual practices.
4. **Defaults:** System settings should be secure by default, reducing reliance on individuals to adjust their security settings.
5. **Salience:** Highlighting important cybersecurity practices can attract attention and encourage compliance.
6. **Priming:** Making users aware of potential cybersecurity threats can lead to more vigilant behavior.
7. **Affect:** Leveraging emotions like fear or anticipation of regret can motivate individuals to adhere to security policies.
8. **Commitment:** Making public pledges to adhere to cybersecurity protocols can reinforce personal and organizational consistency in following them.
9. **Ego:** Balancing productivity with security is critical; employees should not feel they must choose between being effective and being secure.

**Integration with Protection Motivation Theory:**
- Protection Motivation Theory, which includes threat appraisal and coping appraisal, can be aligned with the Mindspace model.
- **Threat appraisal** concentrates on understanding the severity of threats and personal vulnerability. Messages must be clear, and norms should support the recognition of threats.
- **Coping appraisal** includes evaluating the perceived response cost, ensuring the response efficacy, and providing training and norms that support security measures.

**Research Insights:**
- Threat appraisal is a strong predictor of engagement with security policy compliance.
- Vulnerability perception is linked to improved cybersecurity intentions.
- Coping appraisal has been shown to predict compliance with organizational security policies.

**Conclusion:**
- The Mindspace model provides a framework for developing strategies to persuade and encourage users to follow cybersecurity best practices.
- Integrating Mindspace with motivational theories like Protection Motivation Theory can help design effective cybersecurity behavior change support systems.

**Actionable Points:**
- Organizations should bear in mind the importance of the trust in messengers of cybersecurity.
- Implementing secure defaults and making aware of norms can lead to better cybersecurity practice adherence.
- Emphasizing commitment and addressing ego-related conflicts can ensure that employees feel both productive and secure.

By understanding and applying the principles of the Mindspace model, individuals and organizations can foster more secure behaviors in the realm of cybersecurity.

Cybersecurity. In this video, we're going to look at behavior change support system, but then in the domain of cybersecurity. Specifically, we're going to look at the Mindspace model. The Mindspace model is an acronym for message, incentive, norms, default, salience, priming, effect, commitment, and ego. It helps you to remember a couple of important effects and things you could do to increase people's behavior towards more secure on internet or online environment. Mindspace has been used in the UK by the cabinet office, so Downing Street. I think, if I'm not mistaken, it was the time that Tony Blair was in office, so I don't know what happened afterwards, but that's from that time period. They use these things to motivate and increase people's awareness about cybersecurity. The Mindspace model specifically focuses on system one. Okay, now let's dive into it. Mindspace messenger, we are actually influenced here, that's the point, by who is sending the message, who is communicating things. Incentives, again, we've seen already the rewards. We do things because we might get rewarded or being punished about things. Norms is about what is the default norm, the things that others do in the organization, the defaults. We have seen that before. Salient is attention being given and priming, commitment, and ego. Now, let's look at them step by step. So, the messenger. So, do people trust the person who sends out the information about cybersecurity? Sometimes the expert cybersecurity officers have seen a bit of a noise. Unrealistic security policies have been given and then people might ignore it. In these cases, employers often might look at their peers or direct line manager for, should we really do this? Is it something you also are following this? Yeah. So, remember that if you are in a position as a person from a cybersecurity perspective, that you might push the information, but the other side might not accept it because of who you are. So, make sure not to forget who the messenger is. Incentive. Yes, so we've seen before already when we talked about behaviorism, the rewards can help or a punishment. And in the case of compliance with cybersecurity policy, it's possible that sanctions can improve compliance. But there are a couple of requirements before that might work. So, poor behavior is detected reliable. So, people know if you avoid it or not comply, there's a reliable check that you can be detected. Sanctions are also enforced early on. So, people see it quickly. All right. If you didn't do it and not after too long to wait, because then people think there is no connection between the reward and the stimuli. And then, or the response, how you behave. And it has to be effective. And that makes sense that you asked people to do. Rewards seems to be less effective in this thing. Also, a warning is severe sanctions. If it's too strong, you might run the risk of almost a breakdown in social norms or rebellion. So, careful there if you go on overboard with the sanctions. Now, norms, we've talked about that before already in other models, but it's important if you look at cybersecurity is what's the norm in the organization? Is everyone following this idea of cybersecurity or is everyone very relaxed about it? Yes. So, an important determinant is what your other people in your organization are doing. Default. We are seeing that with the nudging that defaults are important. So, make sure that default system is set up with the default security setting. Yes. So, don't rely on people to set the system more secure. Make sure the default is already secured. Salient. It's important that people's attention is being drawn to the things what you desire people to do. Yes. So, for example, in a menu, if one item is important, make sure it's highlighted and draw the attention to. Another way of using it is in nudging in a sense, for example, picture nudging. So, they've done some work there is the idea before you're sending something away, use some pictures of potential people who might read your information. Would you then still send it like this? Yes, it's your mother and someone, a dictator or the police or some companies which you might or not trust. Would you be happy if they get your information? Time nudge. That's also an interesting one. Give people some time if they send it away, but then still can pull it back. Yes, they might think, oops, is that really sensible that I sent? You can read it. They might not send away this email, just little mails, which might they think, all right, that's maybe not that smart to send around. And sentiment nudge is another interesting nudge. Nudging is that you, the computer check the sentiments, the emotional elements and might see if it's offensive and might warn, do you really want to send this? Might be offensive. Yes. So, have people think through before they send. Now, these are kind of things to make salient, like draw attention to potential risks that people might be having. Priming. Yeah. So, cues, point out, make people aware. And so, if people get information about recent attacks, they become aware about the possibility of these attacks. It becomes, you are primed. And once you're primed, you start being more careful and watch out for these kinds of things. Yes. So, priming, make sure that people start recognizing, oh yeah, there were these phishing mails is going on. And if they see that on a funny email, they think, yes, I know that might be phishing. But if it is not in the front of their mind, they might just forget about it and click on this. Yes. So, priming is also an important strategy. Now, effect. You can use emotions to relate or elicit certain emotion. Yeah. There's a relation between how people are scared they are and maybe that the strength of their password that they picked up because they feel vulnerable to be for such threats. Now, you can also shaming in people into complying or using a listed anticipatory regret. So, would you be happy in the future if they found out it was your fault that this whole system in our company were hacked? Yes. That's another strategy. So, you can use this emotion to elicit a kind of response that people start taking cybersecurity more serious and act in a certain way. Now, commitment. That's also important. It's a kind of a public statement, a promise to follow certain rules or you set yourself to. Now, it's important that we know already for this consistency. If you say you will be cyber, try to be secure on the internet and people know that you made a statement and you want to follow your this because you make the promise and your public statement and you want to be consistent to this self-image. Now, often we confuse the idea between commitment and responsibility. Yes, commitment and you personally make, you see that you're responsible where the responsible can be given to someone but maybe not accepted. Yeah. So, don't make that mistake. You have to come up with commitment and people buy into it instead of you are responsible. Yeah, that's what you think. Yeah. So, don't mix those two up. And ego. Ego is also important. People want to have a positive self-image and sometimes they struggle because they want to be effective in the organization and sometimes they feel if to be effective, yeah, then if you do all those security rules, you cannot be effective. Yes. And then, yeah, they might say, all right, I give more priority to be productive and then move away from the security. Now, therefore, it's important that there's managerial support for being secure and also combine it. So, try to avoid the conflict between a person have to be effective or safe. Yes, you want to create a win-win situation where you want to be both and effective and secure. And that you have to help people to build their self-efficacy, that they can do this to be secure and successful at the same time. Interesting in this work also is that they use the mind space with all these kinds of suggestions that you can look at the message and commitment, this kind of how you can put that against the protection motivation theory, which we also talked about in previous videos. So, in this protection motivation theory, we normally we think about health, but you can also show your health as cybersecurity health. And then again, still have the threat appraisal and the coping appraisal. And with these appraisals, you can set on the other side, the mind space model. Let's look at it in more detail. So, the threat appraisal, we talked about severity and vulnerability. So, how severe is the threat and how vulnerable are you? Yes, so for severity, do people in our organization understand the severity of the threat? Do they understand what could happen if the organization is being hacked? Now, here, if you look at the mind space, you can say, is the message clear? Who is sending this information? Is it salient? Is it clear to people? Are they getting attention about this information that there is a severity threat? And what's the social norm? How are other people in the organization reacting to that? Vulnerability, do people feel that there's a potential risk? Have personal perception or they think, oh, no one will hack my password. No one will try to penetrate my system. Yes. So, here again, you can use the mind model to look for example, the effect. So, do you usually worry about it or do they never think about it? It's not their problem. And the ego, yes, is there again the idea that I'm responsible for it and my boss is also appreciating that we do this. And a commitment, another. Are we committed to this responsibility of cybersecurity? Threat is one side. Coping appraisals, the other important part. Yes, do people feel they can do it? The response cost, do they feel it's not again in conflict between being successful or being safe? So, does the messenger, the boss, give the right priority? If he only talks about successfulness and somewhere very low on the priority list is safety, then of course, your employees might also copy that idea. Incentives, are they right? Sanctions or rewards? And what's the default? Make sure that the costs are small, the default, so people will follow often the default, yes? Now, response efficacy, training, who is the norms that can people do that is a kind of a shadow security policy. You could say the official policy is it, but everyone else on the workflow is just put the name and the password on a post-it and put it on the screen, yes? That's also not good. So, make sure that the efficacy is appropriate. Okay, now, well, it's a little bit research also on this idea whether it's working with the threat and coping. Yes, some studies found that in the case that the threat appraiser is a strong predictor of the energy towards secure policy compliance. Also, the link about vulnerability, if people feel vulnerable, that they start showing better intention for cybersecurity things. So, one example is the example of the BleedHat security incident. So, when BleedHat was there, then lots of people start changing all of a sudden their passwords. So, there's some research there, you have to use 39% after BleedHat became known, change their password or cancel their account. So, you can see if the threat becomes more known, people will get more salient, more attention to it, people start to respond. So, they see this vulnerability goes up. Coping appraisal, yeah, that's also as a predictor being found for compliance with organizational security, yes? So, make sure that people see the cost for applying big compliance to the cybersecurity policy as well spent and not too much. Okay, so, rounding it up. So, Mindspace, a number of things and massive incentive norms and default that can help you to create an environment that people might be more persuaded to follow cybersecurity policies. Okay, I hope you enjoyed this video where we showed that the things we learned about persuasive technology can also apply to the domain, in this case, cybersecurity. See you in the next video.
