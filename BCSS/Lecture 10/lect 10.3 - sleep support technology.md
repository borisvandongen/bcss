Summary:

The video lecture discusses a sleep care project centered on a mobile app designed to assist individuals with sleep problems or insomnia. The app incorporates elements of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia, focusing specifically on "sleep restriction" and "relaxation training."

Sleep Restriction: It is a CBT technique that involves limiting the time spent in bed to only the time spent asleep. The app uses "sleep efficiency" (the ratio of time spent sleeping to the total time in bed) to calculate how many hours a user is allowed to be in bed. For example, if the sleep efficiency is below 85%, the app restricts the amount of time a person can spend in bed. This technique is challenging as it makes individuals very tired during the day but aims to reinforce the bed as a cue for sleep.

Relaxation Training: Techniques that help individuals relax and fall asleep more easily.

Experiment 1 – Reminders: The first experiment tested whether reminders would help people adhere to behaviors such as recording their sleep or performing relaxation exercises. Three conditions were compared: no reminders, automatic reminders, and self-set reminders. The study found no significant difference between the reminder conditions, but both were more effective than having no reminders. 

Two theories were proposed to explain why reminders might work:
- Self-Empowerment: The idea is that setting a personal reminder leads an individual to follow through with the behavior since they initiated the reminder themselves.
- Opportune Moment: The theory suggests reminders are effective when they come at a moment when the individual is able to act on them, such as detecting when a person has been stationary for a while, which may indicate availability to perform a task.

Experiment 2 – Effectiveness of the Mobile App: A randomized controlled trial tested the mobile app's effectiveness in treating insomnia. Two groups were compared: one using the sleep care mobile app and one on a waiting list (control group). The group using the app showed significant improvements in self-reported sleep problems (using the Insomnia Severity Index) and an increase in sleep efficiency, indicating the app's treatment was effective.

Conclusion: The lecture concludes that reminders can be an effective tool to improve adherence to sleep-tracking and relaxation exercises, and CBT for insomnia can be effectively delivered through a mobile app.

Sleep support technology? Nah. In this video I want to talk about a sleep care project that we have done, which is a mobile app which helps people with sleep problems or insomnia. We're going to look at two specific pieces of research. We're going to look at how reminders work and another one is the effectiveness of this mobile CBT for insomnia. CBT for insomnia, so cognitive behavioral therapy, consists about cognitive therapy, which is about people's beliefs, attitudes, ideas about sleep, and the behavioral part, the action and doing things, the sleeping in this case. If you break it up, there are a couple of therapy parts you see in people with insomnia, which is sleep restriction, which we will talk much more in detail later on, which is about limiting the amount of time you lay in bed to only sleeping. So that's restricting the sleeping. Stimulus control, that you associate your bed with sleeping and not working or laying in bed awake. Sleep hygiene and education has to do with psychoeducation about sleeping and relaxation training, yes, that people are not tensed and relaxed and easily falling asleep. In the sleep care project, we focus specifically on sleep restriction and relaxation. Let's talk a bit more about sleep restriction. Sleep restriction is the idea, as I mentioned already before, that when you lay in bed, you actually sleep and not just lay and be awake. The indicator for that is sleep efficiency. So here, if you sleep six hours, but you lay in bed eight hours, then your sleep efficiency is 75%. So 100% means you're in bed and only sleeping and that's it. And less efficiency than you lay a lot awake in bed. Now, in our application, the idea was, for example, if your sleep efficiency was below 85, then we calculated how many times you could lay in bed. So for example, your sleep time would be six hours then allowed. But if your sleep efficiency is about 85, you could six hours plus 20 minutes, yes. So based on the sleep restriction or sleep efficiency, you would calculate how many hours you were allowed to lay in bed. Outside these hours, you had to go out bed and not sleep. Don't do any extra sleeping on the couch. That was not allowed only at these times. So sleep restriction is quite hard because people are very tired in Minnesota and want to sleep most time during the day. But with sleep restriction, you don't allow that, but only a limited amount when in the evening. So you really get tight and when you see the bed, you fall asleep immediately. That's the idea. So you restrict your sleeping and then you start also associated the bed with sleeping. That's sleep restriction. Quite tough because the first time you really get tight before you really start getting this rhythm. In the experiment, we first were focusing on reminding people for recording how much they sleep because for the sleep restriction, you need to know how much you sleep and stay awake. So you measure that, for example, for a whole week and you keep track. In our case, manually, you keep a sleeping diary. But you have to do this. So you have to be reminded to do this. The other thing you could be reminded of to do your relaxation exercises. So our first experiment was how can we remind people to do that, to adhere to this behavior, recording your sleep or doing your sleeping exercises. So we run an experiment in which we had one condition was no reminders. Another was an automatic reminder and the last condition was a self-set reminder. So the idea was what would work, reminding or not, do people on their own without reminding them to write down their sleep daily report or their relaxation exercises or would reminders work. And then we wanted to know what type of reminders. So the idea behind the different types of reminder has to do with why you think reminders might work. So we have two theories for that. One is a self-empowerment. So if you set yourself a reminder and then you get the reminder, you do it because you were the first to set up your reminder. Yes. So it empowers you to control your own reminders instead of a computer who determines when the reminders triggered. Yes. So empowerment, we thought, was an explanation why people would adhere to recording in their diary. So that's one explanation. The other explanation is the reminders are of an opportune moment. So it's opportunity driven. So people adhere to the call of the reminders because the opportunity is right. So the automatic reminders, that has to do with the COM-B model that we talked about before. So the opportune moment, for example, was that the mobile phone could trigger, detect whether you were sitting on a spot for a whole time. So basically, WiFi he could track. So he thought, all right, if you'll be sitting there for two hours, maybe it's a time that you might have time to do a little bit of the recording in your diary. Or another thing we also tracked was what were you doing in your mobile phone? So if you were engaging, for example, in Facebook, we thought Facebook might not be so relevant. So maybe it's also a good point of time that you say, all right, maybe you can spend your time now to do the diary recording or the relaxation. Yes. So by figuring out what the person is doing, finding the right moment, good opportunity, then do the reminding. And that's the reason why people think, all right, that's the right time. I will record and update my diary. So that was the experiment. By the way, the results were that the reminders work. So independent of which type of reminder, the self-set or the automatic reminder, they were better than a no reminder. So if you look at the diary adherence, there were no difference between the two conditions, whether it's self-set or opportunity. And we didn't find anyone is better. What we did find was the explanating power. So if the self-empower people also felt it, that was also correlated with their diary adherence increase. And the same for opportunity, which could also explain this relationship between the reminder type and the diary adherence. We can't explain by opportunity. So you see correlation going up at the same time. Okay. Then the other experiment that we did in this, the sleep care project was to test whether it actually worked, the effectiveness of the treatment. And we did, you could say, an ABA test or a random control trial in which we had one group of people randomly assigned to a waiting list condition. So we didn't do anything with them. We did just the same pre and post measure. And the other people were randomly assigned to a condition where they use the mobile app. And I have to see very closely. This is very small numbers. So there were 74 people in the intervention, use the mobile phone, and in the waiting list, 77. Now, what were the results? If you want to read a little bit more about this kind of test, it's also in the book from Wendel, that is chapter 13, which I don't discuss here, but there you also see this kind of tests with different conditions. Here the application, different screenshots you could see. So you could have a discussion with your coach, for this time it was in text. You could see your sleep efficiency, your diary, and these kinds of things. But let's look at the results. So the results you could see here, one graph is the ISI, that is kind of self-reported, how much problems you have with sleep. And the other is the sleep efficiency. Now let's start with the self-report. So the blue line, the WL, the waiting list condition, compare with the red line, the app. And you can see that in the app, the problem is going much down, if you compare it to the pre and the post, and the follow-up, which a couple of months later we did, I think. You see, it's a stable, sleep has improved. Now, sleep efficiency, you see here, the efficiency jumps up with the app condition. So here you have a result where you compare this thing and see the effect, what you try to achieve. Let's round up. So in this video, I hope to see that these reminders can work. We didn't find a difference between the opportunity and the empowerment, the self-set or the automatic, but you can see that the empowerment and opportunity is an explanation why these reminders seem to work. Also, with the result, you see that the effectiveness, so CBT using a mobile phone can actually work. Okay, I hope you enjoy it and see you in the next video.
