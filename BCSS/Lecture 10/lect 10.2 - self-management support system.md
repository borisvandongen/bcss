Summary of Self-Management Support System Lecture:

Topic: Self-Management Support System, specifically the Admire Project

Key Points:
1. **Project Overview**: The Admire project aimed at helping patients monitor potential kidney transplant rejection during the first year post-surgery, utilizing home monitoring equipment focusing on creatinine levels.

2. **Technology Used**: Patients utilized a home device to measure creatinine levels by a simple blood prick. The readings were inputted into "MeinNierInzicht" (MyKidneyInsight), an online system that alerts patients when readings are concerning and advises them to contact the hospital.

3. **User Experience Feedback**: Through focus groups with experienced patients, the researchers showed screen designs and gathered feedback. They realized the importance of tailoring the system to varying levels of health literacy among users.

4. **Health Literacy and Health Situations**: It was found that health literacy impacts user interface needs over time. The desire for simplicity and clarity was also emphasized, along with the emotional response to health conditions (normal, moderate, or severe concerns).

5. **Communication Styles**: Adjustable communication styles were developed for users based on their health literacy levels and health situation severity. Those with higher health literacy and experience preferred factual styles, while less experienced patients benefitted from a guided style with additional explanatory scaffolding.

6. **Information Presentation**:
   - Instruction Layer: Basic pop-up instructions for action.
   - Interpretation Layer: More details about the health situation.
   - Factual Layer: in-depth information for users that want comprehensive details.

7. **Interface Variations**: Interfaces were color-coded (green for normal, red for serious concerns, orange for mild concerns) and adjusted the amount and depth of information presented based on the severity of health alerts.

8. **Hypothesis Testing**: The researchers tested whether patients would understand and behave appropriately in response to the system’s advice. Six conditions (two interface styles and three health situations) were paired with three patient experience groups.

9. **Results**:
   - Patients generally did as they were instructed by the system.
   - Less experienced patients tended to do more than necessary (overreact).
   - More experienced patients tended to do less than necessary (underreact).
   - The hypothesis was confirmed that more information was sought in "mild concern" situations, especially using the guided interface.

10. **User Preferences**: Preferences for interface styles varied depending on user experience, with less experienced patients preferring guided interfaces and more experienced patients preferring factual ones.

Conclusion:
The video emphasizes the importance of personalizing health system interfaces based on the patient's health literacy and the specific health situation. Instead of only considering traits like age or extroversion, tailoring the system to the patient’s experience can significantly affect usability and compliance. The Admire project illustrates this through its adaptable user interface for post-kidney transplant self-monitoring.

## Transcript

Self-management support system. In this video, we're going to look at one example, the Admire project that I was involved in. And after this video, you should be able to explain a bit of the e-health concepts that we use in the case of self-monitoring or self-management at home. So in the case of the Admire project, it was about people going home after they had a kidney transplant and then for a year long have to monitor themselves whether there's no rejection of the kidney. And this work was done with TNO and Leiden and the PhD student working at the time was Wenxing Wang. And now let's look at the work there. So the measure, what the people took was a small device set at home and the creatinine trend they had to measure. So sometimes a couple of times a week, little prick of blood in the device and the device would give a measure and a reading and that they had to enter into the system. Here, you can see the system, it's MeinNierInzicht in Dutch, which has a bit of your overview or of your functioning of your kidney. And every time you enter your information that you got from the reading, you entered it in the system and then it could give up a pop-up in case, for example, that something was wrong, a bit concerned there, then he would, for example, here, that's in Dutch, the level is a bit too high. We see the trend is going up too much. Please contact the hospital, yeah? So that was the setting. And what we did at the time then was have a focus group with experienced patients and show the screen designs and talk with them what they thought about having such a system at home. And we also then involved a coach, a virtual coach there, which could guide you through the process. Now, a couple of things we learned from the focus group. First of all, the difference in health literacy. We only realized that there's a difference in how much people understand the health situation when after reflecting back to the focus group, because we had invited experienced patients and they were less interested, if we might say, in this virtual coach explaining things. They wanted to have clarity and know exactly when to go to the hospital. But then we realized that health literacy is something that develops over time that you understand how your body is functioning and reacts to your kidney. And when you might have just had the operation, you might not have that. So there's a difference in the user group or the experience they have, which we might have to take into account when we develop the system. So that's what we did. So first of all, the thing we found is health literacy, that difference over time. And we should maybe adopt the interface to it. The next thing we learned was the health situation. As I mentioned before already, these participants or in the focus group indicated that they want clarity. We first said why it's so important, but during the health situation, there is a different emotion attached to it. So if things are all right, they didn't want to be bothered so much because they want to go on with living. On the other side, if there was a reason to go to the hospital, they definitely didn't want to miss the warning. So it should be clear, no distraction there. Yes, so if they're concerned, there's then, and in the middle, if there's mild concern where the system might say, yeah, I don't know for sure, maybe it needs an extra remeasurement. Yes, then there's a bit anxious going on. So this, again, stress to us that we have to come up with an interface which reacts differently depending on the health situation, because there are other emotional reactions attest to that. And need, for example. Now let's look at the communication styles. Yes, so as I mentioned before, we created different communication styles for these two kind of domains, you can think, yes? The health literacy and the health situation itself. Now let's go back to the health situation. So the health situation, we know that it was all right. Then there was an opportunity to actually give them some information to learn a bit more about the environment, because they would be relaxed. And if they had a bit of time and were interested, that was the moment we thought we'd give them information about, all right, maybe healthy food, exercises, these kinds of things. When it was concerned, then the essential and mental age focus on what's essential. Don't provide more information, just clear message, you need to contact the hospital. Interesting is the middle, the mild concern. Here, we, in a sense, not recommended yet to contact the hospital, but you could see that people would worry because the system says, ah, mild concern, remeasure, there's something going on. Now, in this situation, with this bit of anxiety going on, provide additional information because here there's an information need. So that was our strategy. Then we had a very interesting discussion going on as should we, people recently from the hospital, not overload them with information? Could they handle this information yet? Or should we wait until they develop this health literacy that they can understand all this information? Yes, for example, the measure instrument is not always that reliable. And should we tell them that? Or should we then just make them worry for nothing? But if we only later tell them when they have more experience, would they then say, look, you withhold information, don't trust the system anymore. So how do we deal with it? We don't want to scare them, but on the other hand, we also don't want to keep information from them. So there we use the idea of scaffolding, yes? So we help, I mean, we're open to the patient, but we try to explain it on a level that they understand it at that time. And if they want to learn more of it, we provide more information. So you put the scaffolding around it, provide it in a way that they understand it. And if they grow, you could say, the health literacy, then we don't need all this additional extra explanation. So this lead us to create a kind of information presentation, a kind of layers. So we had an instruction layers on the top, which just give the pop-up, which says, look, you have to do something. And we split the interface in two styles, by the way, we had a guided style and a factual style. So the factual style didn't provide all the additional information. It was more for the people with health literacy, the more experienced, they didn't need all this additional scaffolding information. They just got the factual information. The guided style helps people to build up their conceptual ideas. And you have to think about, there was not yet a schema, a mental idea, cognitive, cognitions, which we talked about in the learning thing. So we built the information there. So we had the instruction layer. If people say, all right, I understand. Instruction layer, we're just telling you what to do. But we leave an opening to, if you want more information to explain why you need it, then they could go to the interpretation layer. Here you would give more information. Could be about your rental situation, the current state, or it could be about explaining the factors, why this measurement might turn up this way. And then if they say after the interpretation layer, I want even more, then you go to the factual layer, yes? And that is the same information that people on the factual style could immediately get if they want more information. Now let's look how it then looked in the interface. So the factual style, here you got a warning with, all right, mild concern, orange report. And then if people want more information, could click more. And then they got here on the side, a panel which give you factual information about what has been measured. And so, and not an interpretation, what it actually could mean in a sense. Now, the guided style, here we focus more for patient. They recently, more recently, left the hospital. And then we also focus more on empathic response. So here's the virtual character, also showing this kind of information, this emotional, like, ooh, something serious going on now. She looks a bit serious because mild concern. Yes, so also explaining that, that you would understand that a patient is now a bit concerned. Here, you could click again on, it's orange, but I want more information here in the instructions. But if you want to learn more, here's more information. Now, here's more information. You see here on the other side, the pop-up with explaining what is going on, but not yet the factual thing. Yeah, it's still an interpretation layer. There, if you want more, well, actually the facts, then they got the facts. And you could see here the information what you actually got in the factual style. So the idea is that if people have been through this cycle a couple of times, they could remove, move away from this guided style and would use the factual style because they would understand there's layers in between. They have created those schemas, basically, in their mind. Okay, now, the health situation I mentioned already was the other dimension. So your health literacy. Health situation is you had this green, red, and orange. Yes, green, everything's all right. Red, concern, and orange, mild concern. And you see the interface is also slightly different here. Green, not much information. Little line for you want to learn a little bit more. Here's some tips and hints for the day. Red in the other side was also not much more information. Go to the hospitals, the main message there. And the orange there, you see more information because you asked people to indicate there is some concern there. But don't go yet to the hospital now. Imagine you're a patient. You're scared that you might lose your kidney. And you, of course, want to go to the hospital if there's some concern. So if the system gave you a little bit of a warning and said not to do it, then you have to give an explanation to tell people why it's not necessary yet to go to the hospital. So that's the more information need. Now, we want to test this hypothesis, hey, because you saw that the information need differ depending on the situation and also the preference of the systems, the factual and the guided system, depending how long it was that you have been operated on and develop some understanding about your health situation. So what did we do? In the hospital, we invited participants there, participants, patients, and asked them, what would you do in this situation? What we did, we put all predefined measurements in it and then said, look, this is how it looked like, the system, and it suggests to do this. Can you explain me what the system tells you to do and what you would do? Because we want to make sure, do they understand the message and what's their behavior? So there were six conditions. So you had the guided and the factual, that sort of two conditions, and we had the three health situation condition, all right, mild concern and concern. Then we had three subject groups. The less experienced, these were people who had the operation between two and seven months before they participated, but no experience in such a health system at home. So they wouldn't use, haven't used it before. Then we had an intermediate group, and the operation has been more than 12 months ago, but they also didn't have any experience with using such a system at home. And then we had the full experience group. 12 months ago, they had the operation, and they had participated in an experiment already, a random control trial where they use such a system, not completely the system that we were testing, but a bit of an idea where you do your measurement at home. So these were the three groups. The results, now, the results show, and what we're gonna look at is what would you do? So here you have an overview. On one side, you see the different group, the less experienced, the mediated, and the full experienced. Situation, three times. All right, mild concern and concerned. You see that repeating three times. And on this side, you could see what people would do. Would they do nothing extra, remeasure, or go to the hospital? Yes? Now, here you see the green things. The green things is what should you do is, yes, they did what they were supposed to do. Yes, so let's take one, the top one. 25 of them, when they were presented from the less experienced group, where they presented with an all right situation, 25% did nothing extra because that was also the instruction. Like, you don't have to do anything. Then, when they were concerned with a mild concern situation, and they requested 28 who did the remeasurement. And last one, 30 have to go to the hospital. Concerned, 30 people went then also to the hospital. Yes? Now, let's see, because this seems quite good. So what the system asked, they understood what they had to do, and they also did what was expected of them. Now, are there situations where they did too much? Yes, here you can see the more orange part. And to do too much was specifically in the less experienced people. Yes, their health literacy was still limited, and they might be a bit more concerned than if you're more experienced, and they would, if they're not sure of it, still go, for example, to the hospital or remeasure when it was not really required. Yes? So you can see, less experienced, you see a little bit more than needed. The opposite, to do too little, when the system suggests you have to do a remeasurement or something, that happened when people were more experienced. You see here, lots of red flares going up with the full experienced group, where they did too little when they had to do a little bit more. Okay, another thing that's interesting is to see when did they click for more information? Yes, because as predicted, the hypothesis was that in the orange, mild concern situation, people would go for more information. Well, the other conditions, they would not search for information because even in the green situation, it is all fine. You can move on with your life. Red, go to the hospital. You don't have to look for more information. That's such a simple message. Now here, you can see also the number of clicks that look for more information. And it's split up again, the different mild concern situations and the different groups. Are they less experienced, intermediate group or the full experienced group and the blue orange for the factual interface and the guided interface. Now, overall, you see some trends, but the most important point that we tried to test was in the mild concern. And here you see way more clicks of more information, specifically for the guided group, in the guided group situation that they wanted more information, as specifically as we hypothesized. Yeah. Okay, then we also asked the three patient group their preference for the two interface style, the guided with this scaffolding and the avatar there and the more factual. Now, specifically, if you confront them with an all right situation, there you see the big difference in relative preferences, where the less experienced, you see the more preference for the guided with the avatar and the other more experienced group that had an operation 12 months ago, at least, what more preference for the factual style. Now, if you move to the mild concern or concern, then you see they come more close to each other. All right. So I hope with this little video, I tried to convince you that if you want to personalize your interface, it's not always people think about traits like that's an extrovert or a male or someone old. You also could adopt the interface based on the experience of the patient. So help literacy is an important thing which you could adopt your interface. And the other is the health situation itself. Different health situations, you are linked with different needs of information. Okay, I hope you enjoyed it and see you in the next video.
