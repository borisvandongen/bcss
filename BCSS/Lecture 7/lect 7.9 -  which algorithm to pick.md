Summary:

Choosing the right algorithm for a given situation involves careful consideration of both the context and the characteristics of the available algorithms. Here are the key points:

**Context Consideration:**
1. **Persuasion Frequency and Timing**: The number of times and the interval between attempts to persuade impact the method used and the potential for changing future behavior.
2. **Duration and Adaptability**: The length of the persuasion period may require adapting strategies as people's preferences evolve over time.
3. **Novelty Effect**: Initial excitement about a new system can wane, affecting its effectiveness.
4. **Success and Failure Impact**: The importance of early success and the consequences of failure can vary from user dropout to severe repercussions.
5. **Outcome Objectives**: Whether the goal is to maintain or increase an outcome measure (e.g., physical activity without injury).
6. **Feedback Utilization**: The ability to include user feedback can inform future interactions.

**Understanding Persuadees and Stakeholders:**
1. **Persuadee Identification and Data**: Knowing who the persuadees are and having demographic data and preferences can inform customized strategies.
2. **Persuadees' Support for Goals**: The strategy may differ if persuadees do or do not support the ultimate objectives of the persuasion.
3. **Other Stakeholders' Requirements**: The need for explainability and predictability for stakeholders such as doctors, partners, etc., can influence the choice of the algorithm.

**Algorithm Characteristics:**
1. **Type of Algorithm Core**: Consideration of whether the algorithm is based on theory, expert knowledge, offline data, or online data and availability of these resources.
2. **Effectiveness, Explainability, and Predictability**: Each algorithm's start-up effectiveness, transparency, and reliability should match the context needs.
3. **Other Features**: Whether an algorithm is forward or backward directed, takes into consideration future states, uses positive or negative feedback, and other characteristics like strategic dialogues or balance between exploration and exploitation.

In conclusion, selecting an algorithm requires understanding the specific situation's needs, knowing the audience and stakeholders involved, and matching those needs with the appropriate algorithmic approach and characteristics. This summary provides foundational questions to guide the selection process, though the list is not exhaustive.

Welcome to our video on which algorithm to pick. So which aspects should you consider when you decide on an algorithm for a specific situation? Well, first, we need to consider our situation, and specifically, what we try to persuade people to do, our persuadees. So who are we trying to persuade? And what about other stakeholders in our context? Maybe doctors, or a person's partner, or a child. So let's look at the situation. Here's a set of questions that you can use to try to describe your situation. The list is by no means exhaustive, but it certainly helps you to start thinking. So first, the persuasion. One question is how often you want to persuade people, and what the time between different persuasive attempts is. So for example, when you persuade people multiple times, you might want to consider this effect that repeated actions can have. And you might also want to start considering future states that your persuadees are in. How long is your persuasion period? So if it's very long, then people's preferences might start to change over time. So what you've once learned to be optimal may no longer be optimal two years from now. And there are also effects, such as the novelty effect, that may influence people's preferences. So the novelty effect says that people might initially be very excited about a new system, and then this excitement drops over time as people become aware of the limitations. So then if you've learned something at the start when people are super excited, well, that may no longer hold when people are suddenly less excited. Another question is how important it is to be successful at the start. We've mentioned this earlier when we discussed the algorithm course. So what happens when you're not successful? Do people just drop out? For example, in a behavior change process, that would be pretty bad because then you directly lose your people at the start. What are the consequences of failing to persuade people? So does it mean less user satisfaction? Does it mean less profit on some sort of online website for buying some products? Or does it even mean death in the most extreme case? And do we want to maintain a certain level of an outcome measure, or do we want to keep increasing it? For example, too much physical activity may lead to injury. And do we want to and can we include feedback on previous activity? So do we have access on what people have done in the past, or do we not have that? Then let's move to our persuadees, so the people we are trying to persuade. What do we know about them in advance? So can we even identify them? Because if we don't know who they are, we cannot adapt to them over time, for example. Do we know their demographics, their age, their gender, their socioeconomic status? What data can we gather on them and how? For example, can we ask them specific questions, such as how do you like to be motivated? Do our persuadees support the goal of the persuasion? In the context of quitting smoking, we may assume that they want to quit smoking and we help them accomplish this goal. In the context of e-commerce, if we try to persuade them to buy the most expensive product, well, maybe they don't support this goal. And if they don't support it, then we cannot ask them, hey, what motivates you to buy something on our website, or what persuades you to spend most money that they will probably not want to answer. And our other stakeholders, so as I said, this might be a doctor, this might be a therapist, this might be a person that lives with our persuadee, the partner, a relative, et cetera. How important is it that we can explain the decisions to these other stakeholders that our algorithm makes? And how important is it that our system is predictable? And these two factors may impact whether people are even willing to use the system or to prescribe it to their patients, et cetera. Besides the situation, once we have analyzed them, we should then consider different characteristics of algorithms that we have seen. So we have seen different types of algorithm cores, such as theory, experts, offline data, and online data. And for each of these elements, we should ask ourselves, well, what do we need? What do we have? And can we get what we need? So if we need online data, can we get that? If we need experts, do we have access to experts? So can we easily reach a person that works with smokers to tell us when a message is appropriate, or can we not? And what are the implications? So how effective is the algorithm from the start? How explainable is it? How predictable is it? And how does that match the situation that we have analyzed beforehand? And then we have seen other characteristics of algorithms, so whether they're forward or backward directed, whether they account for future states, and whether they use positive or negative feedback. We've also seen some other characteristics, such as strategic dialogues, considering the impact of repeated actions, or exploration versus exploitation. For all of these, we should decide which characteristics our algorithm should have and what the implications of that are. As I said, these are only some questions to get you started when thinking about which algorithm to use in your specific situation. The list is not exhaustive, but I think it should definitely be useful to help you anyways. This concludes our video on which algorithm to pick. I hope you found it useful.
