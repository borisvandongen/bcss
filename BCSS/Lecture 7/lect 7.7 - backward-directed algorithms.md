Summary of Backward-Directed Algorithms Lecture:

In this lecture, we examined the concept of backward-directed algorithms, using an approach from Blanton-Henkemans to illustrate the idea. Backward-directed algorithms differ from forward-directed algorithms in their focus on past actions rather than future ones.

Key Definitions:
- Forward-directed: Persuasion or encouragement focusing on future activities or goals, e.g., motivating someone to go for a run tomorrow based on favorable weather.
- Backward-directed: Persuasion or encouragement that focuses on past behaviors or events, providing feedback based on actions that have already occurred.

We discussed the importance of using a backward-directed approach in specific scenarios, particularly in persuasive contexts where acknowledging past behavior can influence future actions. Examples include:
- If a person failed to achieve a goal (e.g., missed a workout), the algorithm can provide encouragement by emphasizing that the setback is a normal part of the learning process and to keep trying.
- If a person succeeded in reaching a goal (e.g., completed a workout), the algorithm can offer congratulations to reinforce positive behavior.

This approach draws on motivational interviewing, which aims to support self-efficacy and optimism through personalized feedback. For a backward-directed algorithm to be effective, it must have access to progress data so it can provide relevant and informed feedback.

Key Points for Students:
- Understand the difference between forward and backward-directed algorithms.
- Recognize the importance of personalizing feedback based on past behavior.
- Acknowledge the necessity for the algorithm to have access to historical data on individual's actions.

To apply this concept effectively, one must ensure that there is a mechanism to track and understand people's progress or lack thereof.

For further learning, students are encouraged to explore motivational interviewing techniques and how they can be incorporated into algorithm design. The video series continues in subsequent lectures, and students are invited to continue watching for more insights.

## Transcript

Welcome to the next video. This video is about backward-directed algorithms. So in our overview, we are now located here, and we will look at an approach by Blanton-Henkemans. Again, I don't know if I'm pronouncing this correctly at all, to illustrate what it means for an algorithm to be backward-directed. So forward versus backward-directed. Say we have a timeline, and a person performs physical activity at different points in time, and we persuade them at this point in time. Now we have two options. One is, we might encourage them that they can actually go for a run tomorrow, or we try to make them more confident about playing basketball next week at some tournament. We could also suggest them to go for running tomorrow, because the weather is great. But instead of this forward-directed notion, we could also be backward-directed in our persuasive attempt. So for example, if a person didn't manage to go for a run yesterday, we could tell them that this failure, actually we should not use the word failure, that this is part of the learning process, and that this can happen, and that this is normal. Or if they actually really went for a fantastic run yesterday, we could congratulate them for doing that. Let's look at an example. We have Laura again, this time also again with a little symbol, and we want to consider whether or not she has reached her goal. So if she has not reached her goal, we might tell her this message, so you were not successful in achieving your goal for today, this is not terrible, it will go with small steps, so keep trying the coming days. And the idea here is that we support self-efficacy and optimism. Now if Laura has reached her goal, we might instead send a message like this. So well done, you are successful in achieving today's goal. And here the idea is that we are cheering and complimenting. Both of these approaches are based on theory, specifically motivational interviewing. So you've seen what it means to be backward-directed. All the other algorithms we've seen so far were mostly focused in the other direction, so they were forward-directed. What is important for this kind of backward-directed algorithm is that we somehow have access to and understand people's progress status, because if we don't know whether they reached their goal yesterday, or what at all they've done yesterday, it's very difficult to refer to that in our persuasive attempt.
