4. Characteristics of Persuasion Algorithms:
   - Negative feedback: Explained and illustrated through Hatanto's approach.
   - Future-state consideration: Demonstrated through the lecturer's own developed approach.
   - Backward-directed algorithms: Defined and exemplified by Blanton-Hinckermans' algorithm.
   - Forward-directed algorithms: Other algorithms that focus on forward motion, in contrast to backward-directed ones.
   - Positive feedback: Contrasts with negative feedback and is used in all other algorithms except Hatanto's.

5. Deciding on the Appropriate Algorithm:
   - Guidance will be provided on how to select suitable algorithms for specific scenarios.

Conclusion:
We've overviewed persuasion algorithms, their different cores and characteristics, and discussed the considerations for choosing the appropriate algorithm tailored to particular situations. Students will learn how to analyze and apply persuasion algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## Transcript

In this video, we are going to give an introduction to the topic of persuasion algorithms. And second, we are going to explain what the goal of this lecture is, and the steps that we are going to take to reach this goal. So let's imagine we have this example person, Laura, who wants to quit smoking. In a traditional setting, you might have a therapist who guides Laura in the behavior change process and motivates her. But using such a therapist has several problems. One, for example, is that a therapist is not available at all times. So if Laura wakes up in the middle of a night with a horrible craving for a cigarette, then the therapist is most likely not going to be able to help her. Another problem is that using therapists for helping all the people who want to quit smoking is very costly. So what we want to see is whether we can use automated approaches to motivate people in a behavior change process. For example, this can be a virtual coach or conversational agent that guides people through the behavior change process. So what is the goal of today's lecture? Well, first, we want to understand persuasion algorithms and their characteristics. We then want to be able to analyze persuasion algorithms with regards to such a set of characteristics. And lastly, we want to see how appropriate persuasion algorithms are in different scenarios. So the first thing we are going to do in this lecture is to look at different cores of persuasion algorithms. For example, some algorithms are based on theory. And for this, we will look at the algorithm by De Vries as an example. Other algorithms are based on experts at their core. And for this, we will look at the approach by Horst Freier. Another type of core is to use offline data. And here, we will look at the second component of the algorithm by Horst Freier to illustrate it. And a fourth core is online data. And to explain this, we will use the algorithm by Roy. Of course, many of these algorithms actually don't just have one core, but they have multiple. So this you see here on the slides. Afterwards, we will discuss other characteristics of persuasion algorithms. And this includes, for example, negative feedback. I will explain later what that is. And I will illustrate this using the approach by Hatanto. Second component that some algorithms have is that they consider future states of persuadees. And I will illustrate this with one approach that we ourselves have developed. And the third element is that algorithms are backward-directed. I will again explain what this means. And I will use for this the algorithm by Blanton-Hinckermans. I hope I pronounced that correctly. And just as there is negative feedback and backward-directed algorithms, there's also forward-directed algorithms. And actually, all the other algorithms besides the one by Blanton-Hinckermans, they're forward-directed. And there are positive feedback approaches. And well, all the algorithms besides the ones by Hatanto are using positive feedback. And again, all these other later algorithms also have cores that they use. After we've discussed the core and other characteristics of algorithms, we will look at which algorithm actually to pick in a certain situation. And we'll see later what kind of questions you can ask, for example, to help determine this. Thank you.
