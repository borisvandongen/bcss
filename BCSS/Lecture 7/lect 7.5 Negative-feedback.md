Summary of Negative Feedback Algorithms Lecture:

- **Concept Overview**: Negative feedback algorithms are systems that don’t solely focus on increasing a value but also work on maintaining or decreasing the value to keep it around a reference point. This concept is contrasted with processes that only increase over time.

- **Definition**: 
  - *Positive Feedback*: Enhances or amplifies changes; this may lead to a continuous rise in a system's output.
  - *Negative Feedback*: Works to stabilize a system by reducing the effects of fluctuations in output.

- **Example of the Concept**: Population dynamics can illustrate negative feedback. In an ecosystem, a high prey population can lead to an increase in predators, who then reduce the prey population, ultimately causing the predator population to decline once the prey is scarce. Thus, the population sizes fluctuate around a reference value.

- **Case Study**: Hatanju’s work on anxiety management during public speaking is discussed. Participants underwent a calibration session, a static session without anxiety regulation, and a dynamic session with regulation.
  
  Outcome Measures:
  - *Length of Speech*: Stayed more stable in the dynamic condition with negative feedback.
  - *Heart Rate Variability*: Indicated lower stress or anxiety levels during the dynamic condition.

- **Applications**: Negative feedback is valuable in various fields, including sleep management, weight control, and physical activity, where the goal is to avoid excessive increase and instead maintain a stable, desirable level.

- **Requirements for Implementing Negative Feedback Algorithms**:
  1. Define the desired outcome level (e.g., ideal anxiety levels, physical activity targets, sleep duration).
  2. Measure the current value for the outcome to ascertain whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the level.
  3. Develop two sets of actions - one for augmenting the value and another for diminishing it.

- **Conclusion**: Negative feedback algorithms are crucial for regulating values within a system, ensuring stable levels rather than unchecked growth or decrease. This can be applied to a wide range of human behaviors and physiological states.

Remember to look into Hatanju's work for additional information on other outcome measures used in the study. The next video will continue exploring related topics.

## Transcript

Welcome to the next video. This video is about negative feedback algorithms. So if you're looking at our overview slide, we are now located here, and we will be discussing the approach by Hatanju to illustrate how negative feedback is used in persuasion algorithms. What is positive or negative feedback? Well, if you look at this line, for example, it should only go up over time. You see there's a little dent that should not be there. I didn't draw that perfectly. So this line goes up over time, and this could, for example, model apple ripeness. But there are also other processes that don't just increase over time. For example, the process could look like this. So importantly, you notice how the value goes down at some point over time. And this could, for example, be the population size of prey. And why does it go down? Well, it has to do with the predator population. So when there is a lot of prey, then there might be many predators, and these predators now eat the prey, so the prey population size goes down. And when the predators have eaten all the prey, then the predator population goes down because there's not much to eat anymore, and the prey population size can recover. So over time, the population size oscillates around some sort of reference value. So to look at an example, well, we're given Laura again. And in this context, we are trying to maintain a stable value of anxiety in the context of anxiety treatment. So we are measuring Laura's anxiety, and then we compare it to a reference value. If the anxiety is less than the reference value, we use an increasing stimulus. And if the anxiety is higher than the reference value, we use a stimulus to reduce the anxiety. And Hatanto have tested this in the context of anxiety for public speaking. What they have done is they had 24 participants, and these participants first went through a calibration session. Then they had a static session where there was no sort of anxiety regulation. And then there was a dynamic session with anxiety regulation. And we can look at two outcome values. One is the length of speak, and one is the heart rate variability. And for both of these, we can see how in the dynamic condition, the value remains more stable over time than in the static condition. The authors looked also at two other outcome measures, and you can look at that in their paper if you are interested. But it's, I think, very interesting to see that it really works to mostly have a stable value for these kinds of outcome measures like length of speak when you have these increasing and decreasing stimuli. And why they use length of speak or heart rate variability, difficult word, because these are both indicators of distress or anxiety. So this really shows that anxiety somewhat remains more stable in the dynamic condition. So what is interesting about these negative feedback algorithms, as I said, is that they don't just care about constantly increasing something, such as the motivation or the appreciation of people for some sort of messages, but they also care about maintaining a stable level. And this is interesting in many different situations. For example, when people have sleep problems, you don't just want them to sleep 40 hours at a time. Similarly, for weight loss, at some point, you want them to start eating again and not just keep losing weight. And for physical activity as well, at some point, if people just keep increasing their physical activity, then there's a high risk of injury. So you also then again need some sort of decreasing stimulus to say, now, well, it's enough. We don't want to continue further. All of this means that, well, you need to first define what the desired level for your outcome measure is. So what kind of anxiety level do you have? What kind of physical activity level do you want? How much should people sleep at night? So you need to define that. You also need to be able to know what people's value for this outcome measure is. So if we don't know how people are sleeping right now, we don't know whether to tell them to sleep more or to sleep less or to maintain what they're doing right now. And we need two types of actions. We need one for decreasing something and something for increasing as well. So we need both. So this concludes our video of negative feedback algorithms. So algorithms that don't just are concerned with increasing a value, but they also want to decrease it at some point to make sure that the value doesn't increase indefinitely. See you in the next video.
