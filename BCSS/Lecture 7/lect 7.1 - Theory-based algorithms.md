Summary of Lecture on Theory-Based Decision Making for Conversational Agents and Virtual Coaches:

This lecture examines theory-based decision-making in conversational agents, specifically within the domain of behavior change. It primarily focuses on using the Trans-theoretical Model of Change (TTM) to tailor persuasive messages to individuals based on their readiness to change.

Key Concepts:

1. **Conversational Agents**: These are virtual entities designed to interact with users through natural language dialogue and are often employed for persuasion or coaching.

2. **Trans-theoretical Model of Change (TTM)**: A theoretical framework that categorizes an individual's readiness to change into various stages: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.

3. **Processes of Change**: According to TTM, different strategies (like consciousness raising or dramatic relief) are suitable for different stages to facilitate behavioral changes.

4. **Theory-based Decision Rules**: The lecture discusses how messages can be tailored based on an individual's current stageâ€”e.g., using consciousness-raising techniques for someone in the pre-contemplation stage.

Illustrative Example:
- An example person, Laura, is in the pre-contemplation stage. She should receive messages that raise her awareness of the benefits of changing her behavior, like exercising for better health.

Study Results:
- A study compared the effectiveness of randomized messages to those tailored to TTM stages regarding self-efficacy and physical activity. Results showed a significant increase in physical activity for both conditions over time, but no stark difference between them. However, there was a notable improvement in motivation with tailored messages in hypothetical scenarios.

Key Considerations:
- When designing a conversational agent based on behavior change theories, you may need to collect online and offline data on user behavior, involve experts, and consider user states (like self-efficacy) or traits (like personality).

Algorithm Characteristics:
- Effectiveness: The algorithm's impact on behavior change was shown to be constant over time.
- Explainability: Decisions are transparent, as they are directly linked to an individual's TTM stage.
- Predictability: The algorithm generates predictable messages once a user's stage of change is identified.

Conclusion:
The lecture emphasizes the importance of theory in designing persuasive systems and highlights the challenges and nuances of effecting behavior change through virtual coaches or automated systems. Despite the theoretical underpinning, changing behavior with messages alone can be complex, and it is important to measure not only the behavior but also proximal variables like motivation.

## Transcript

So in this lecture, we are now looking at conversational agents, virtual coaches or other sorts of artificial agents that make their decisions based on theory. So if we look at this big overview figure that we had at the start, we are now located in the first column, and we look at the approach by de Vries as illustration. So let's say we have this big group of people that we would like to persuade. And as you have seen in one of the previous lectures, we can distinguish these people based on their stages of change according to the trans-theoretical model of change. So for example, the preparation stage or the action stage. And let's say that our example person, Laura, is located in the pre-contemplation stage. And these other people are assigned to the stages like this. And now we know according to the trans-theoretical model, there are different processes of change assigned to these different stages. So different processes of change that are appropriate to use in these different stages. So for example, in the first three stages, you can use consciousness raising, so making people become aware of why it might be important to change their behavior. And there are also other processes of change such as dramatic relief or stimulus control. And now, given that we know that Laura is in the pre-contemplation stage, we could send her a message that matches consciousness raising. For example, this one that says that regular exercise would make you less vulnerable for diseases. So the idea is here that we have a theory, and based on that, we derive decision rules for what kind of motivational or persuasive messages to send. And the theory in this example is the trans-theoretical model of change. The authors of this algorithm have applied it in the context of physical activity. So on this figure, you see the self-efficacy, for example, during 12 weeks for two conditions. One condition, the random condition, received random messages. And the other condition received messages that matched the people's DTM stage. So DTM is the trans-theoretical model. And as you can see here, the self-efficacy is actually slightly higher for the random condition throughout the 12 weeks. But except for week 10, the intervals, the confidence intervals, they overlap. So there's only a significant difference between the two conditions for week 10. But in that week, actually, the random condition performs better than the tailored condition. The authors also looked at the actual physical activity behavior that people performed. And here, you see that the tailored condition performs slightly best throughout the 12 weeks. But the intervals, they overlap throughout. So there is no significant difference between the two conditions. What we can see is that there's actually a significant increase in physical activity over time. But that occurs for both conditions. So you see that it's actually often very difficult to change people's behavior by means of persuasive messages. And this is a theme that you will see also for the later algorithms and for the ways they've been applied and what people found there. The authors of this paper also did another study where they looked at the impact on motivation based on hypothetical scenarios. And there, the tailored condition did perform significantly better. And that is also something you will see again later, if not in this lecture, then in the papers, that often it's easier to observe an effect in these more proximal measures, so the motivation that people perceive. And it's harder to observe an effect in the later measures, so more distal measures in this chain of measures. So the idea is that motivation affects physical activity, so it's easier to observe an effect in the motivation part than in the physical activity part. Because of course, more other factors also impact the physical activity, so it becomes much more noisy and harder to observe effects. So to conclude, we've had a virtual coach or some sort of automated system here that derives its decision rules from theory. And the theory here was the trans-theoretical model. When you have now such an algorithm, it's often also then interesting to see at what we actually need for such an algorithm. For example, do we need to gather online data on user behavior throughout the intervention? Do we need to gather offline data in advance? Do we need some behavior change theory or experts to help us? And do we need data on user states, such as their self-efficacy, or on user traits, so characteristics that change, if at all, very slowly, such as personality? So in this case, we had a behavior change theory, the trans-theoretical model. We did, in this case, also have information about user state, so the trans-theoretical model stage. Whether you actually need that depends, of course, on the behavior change theory that you're using. And whether you need traits, such as personality information, also, again, depends on your behavior change theory that you use in your algorithm. Besides looking at what you need for your algorithm, it's also good to check what you get. Interesting here is to look at how effective your algorithm is from the start, how explainable the decisions are that it makes, and how predictable future decisions are. So in this case, the algorithm is as effective as it is at the start, also later on. It doesn't change. So there's no notion of getting more effective or less effective over time. It is also explainable. We can know why we made a certain decision, because it's entirely based on a person's stage of change. And it's also predictable, because as soon as we know a person's stage of change, we know what kind of messages we can send to that person. So this concludes our video on theory-based algorithms.
