## Summary of Robert Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence

### Definition of Influence
Influence involves strategies used to persuade individuals to adopt certain behaviors or make specific decisions.

### Robert Cialdini
Cialdini, a professor, researched sales tactics and presented six key principles of influence in his book "Psychology of Persuasion."

### Six Principles of Influence:

1. **Reciprocity**: People tend to return favors. If someone does something for you, you're likely to want to reciprocate.

   - **Example in Technology**: In an experiment (Fogg & Nass, 1997), a computer provided assistance in a task, leading participants to help the computer in return.

2. **Social Validation (Social Proof)**: Individuals are more likely to engage in behaviors that they see others, especially similar others, performing.

   - **Example in Social Media**: Video view counts on platforms like YouTube can influence our perception of the video's worth.

3. **Consistency (Commitment)**: Individuals strive for consistency in their actions and beliefs. Once a commitment is made, people are more inclined to follow through.

   - **Example in Sales**: The "foot-in-the-door" technique, where agreeing to a small request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a larger one later.

4. **Liking**: We are more inclined to agree to requests from individuals we like or find similar to ourselves.

   - **Example in Sales**: Salespeople may feign similar interests to create a sense of camaraderie with potential customers.

5. **Scarcity**: Opportunities perceived as scarce or limited are seen as more valuable, prompting quicker action.

   - **Example in Retail**: Advertising limited stock can create a sense of urgency to purchase before items run out.

6. **Authority**: People are inclined to follow the lead of credible, authoritative figures.

   - **Example in Research**: The Milgram experiment and its virtual replication by Slater showed that participants obeyed authority figures, even when uncomfortable with the actions they were instructed to perform.

### Conclusion
Understanding these principles can assist in recognizing and potentially employing persuasion tactics in various contexts, from personal interactions to marketing and technology design.

## Transcript

Principles of influence. In this video, we're going to talk about Caldini, Robert Caldini, who wrote the book Psychology of Persuasion. And in this book, he puts forward six principles of influence. And after this video, you should be able to explain those six principles. Caldini is an interesting person, and he wrote this very interesting book. And what he did as a professor, he took a year off, and then did all kinds of sales courses. Because he really wanted to understand all those strategies salespeople are using to persuade you to buy something as a car salesman, or in a shop, or everything. So here, he got all this experience, and then tried to see what is happening from a more abstract level. And in this book, he writes about it, it's a very easy read and fun to do, so I highly recommend it. But there, he puts forward these kind of principles backed up by psychology. So those six principles are reciprocity, social validation, also called social proof, then consistency, something referred to as commitment, and liking, scarcity, and authority. Now, let's start with reciprocity. And we talked about it already in one of the previous videos, when we talked about persuasive technology. And then we saw persuasion, and the functional triad. And one way of seeing a computer is as a social actor. And because of the social actor, a kind of a similar relationship between you and the computer is created. And there, we saw already kinds of principles that normally work between people we could also rely on with a computer. Now, here, reciprocity was one of the principles. So the idea is that a person is much more willing to comply with a request from someone else who previously provided a favor or a concession. So if you did something for me, then I'm more likely also to do something for you. It's a kind of a universal rule of how people behave to each other. And interestingly, it's also happening if people work with a computer. So, Fock and Ness in 1997 published this piece of paper, a paper on this where they report on an experiment where people work with a computer. And they had to do two tasks with the computer. In the first task, they had to look up for a search, do some searching. And the task was for the computer to provide the findings. The second task was the computer asked the human to do a kind of boring task, which you have to indicate the colors of all kinds of pictures. That mundane task. Now, the difference they had in the experiment, two conditions, how they did task one. So how well did task one support the person? In the reciprocity condition, the computer gave good results, did a bit of effort to find things and help. You could see, right? Make some effort. In the control condition, the computer didn't do well, didn't give you such much results, quite poor results for the task you had to complete. Now, what was the effect? The effect we see in the second task. So people who were in the reciprocity condition where you got your good results, in the second task, they're much more willing when the computer asked them, can you look and do all those judgment tasks about the color? So they spend more time and the quality of their rating much more high. Then the control condition where people in the first task didn't get those good results. Now, if it wasn't a social actor, you would say, what has the first task to do with the other task? But since we're looking at a social actor, you see this reciprocity principle also acting, playing up when working within a computer setting. Okay, now let's move to a next one. So the next one is the social validation or social proof. We should be more willing to comply with a request for behavior if it is consistent with that similar others also think you're doing. So often we have to make decisions which we don't know what we should do. And what we then do, we look around, what did others do? Because there's a good heuristics, of course. If other did it, all right, if so many other did it and they are similar to me and all right, then I might also do this, yes? And you see this often, for example, YouTube, how many people looked at this video? If millions of people looked at this video, it must be good, otherwise why did million people look at it? Yes, these cues we look like we follow others and if they are doing it, we can do it because we use this simple heuristic. Another, consistency. People like to be consistent, yes? And we talked already about social dissonance theory where you have this situation where you have two conflicting ideas in your mind. With consistency, you try to make them consistent. So what you do and what you say. So consistency sometimes also referred to commitment. If you commit to a certain position, to you will do something, then later it's much more likely that you actually will do it because you want to be consistent with what you said before and what you're actually now doing. Now, a famous example here, again, where they refer sometimes to foot-in-the-door technique. So what did experimenters do? They went into a neighborhood and ring on the doorbells and ask people, all right, can I ask you a favor? This is something I don't even know what it is. Could you please, it's a favor or something for, I don't know, let's make up something. The environment, yes. Could you put a little note in your window about I'm all in favor of a green environment. Later, they came back to these people and they ask, all right, I see this little tag that you have in your window. Are you now willing to put this huge sign in your garden? And for those people who initially accepted to put this little thing in their window, they were more liking to put the whole thing in the border billboard in the garden, yes? So the idea is there, if you initially said yes to this, then you want to be consistent because now you see yourself as a person that, all right, finds green things important in life. So if you get a next request, you want to be consistent, yes? So sometime you see this strategy with salespeople. They first ask you to do something similarly small and then they take you to the next step because people want then see themselves and try to be consistent with the initial decision that they make, yes? Or another strategy where we see this is in health applications. First, we try to set certain goals and say, all right, do you want to achieve this? So you want to lose 10 pounds, weight or kilos? Okay, then next step is, all right, we're gonna run today because you want to do this. You want to lose weight, yes? And now people want to be consistent. So, and that's because initially they get a commitment on that. Okay, let's move to another persuasive principle is liking, yes? So, and as it says, we should be more willing to comply with the request of a friend or a liked individual, yes? So if someone who you like ask something, you're much more likely to, yes, to do that than something you don't like. So if you see it to salesperson, so car salesman, try to be your friend or try to be similar than you. If he noticed that you play golf, then all of a sudden he also plays golf. If you are, I don't know, like Bob Marley, they of course also like Bob Marley, yes? So you have this similarity, you're liking, you see this, but now, and also on websites you see that where they put pictures of the normal people who work in that company. See, we are like you, we are just real people, these kind of things. So you try to connect. Now, that is what they try to do, this liking. And you can sometimes see this also in movies where people go to court and then they see the lawyer dressed up as the normal people, like and behave similar as people in the panel, in the jury, yes? Again, they try to show, look, I'm similar to you, you could like me, and that helps to persuade people. Another principle, scarcity. Scarcity is that we try to secure those opportunities that are scarce or dwelling. Now, if something is almost gone and you're the last opportunity to buy it, all right, now there's the pressure there, and some people, all right, then I buy it, because otherwise I missed out this opportunity. And yes, we can see this, for example, on Amazon, yes? There are only one item left. Ooh, if I don't buy it, someone else buys it, and I cannot buy it. Or Apple is coming with a new product, but you have to queue because it's very scarce, and now you stand hours and hours in the queue or in line, then you definitely want to buy it because it's so scarce. Yeah, so all these kind of elements help to persuade people, yes, scarcity. Authority, we talked about it already. If one principle calls for people that follow authority, that people are, because of their knowledge or their position in society, it can all kind of different positions reason why people have an authority, but people follow people with authority in these cases. And also in computers, you see, you can repeat this thing. So the Milgram experiment, it's quite famous, had that a human suspect was asked to, right, give a so-called other participant who didn't exist on the other side electroshocks if he did something wrong, and based on an experiment, they're sitting in a corner and say, yes, continue, please, continue, please, but he is almost dying, please continue, yes. So because that experimenter with a white doctor's coat was sitting in the corner, a kind of an authority figure, people were quite willing to do all kinds of electroshock things. That's the theory, there were no real people executed or getting electroshocked, by the way, don't worry. Slater repeated this experiment, but then with a virtual character. So in here, you had to give the electroshock to a virtual character. Now, of course, you definitely know that this virtual character is not real, but still, he measured the kind of stress people had doing this, and you see that people also didn't like that, to do this kind of electroshock to people. So you see here, again, this kind of reaction that people find this, all right, they have to do it because the experimenter said so, but doing this, I still don't like. Now, authority, therefore, can also play something with computers. Okay, summarizing again. So the principle of influence, reciprocity, social validation, sometimes social proof, consistency or slash commitment, liking, scarcity, and authority. Okay, I hope you enjoyed this video. See you in the next one.
