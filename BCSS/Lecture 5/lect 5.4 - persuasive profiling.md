Summary:

Persuasive profiling is a concept that revolves around tailoring influence strategies based on individuals' past responses to those strategies rather than relying on average responses from a broader group. Maurits Kapitein, through his PhD research, explored this concept and proposed that understanding individual reactions to specific influence attempts is more predictive of future responses than average group behavior.

Kapitein's experiment involved using Bluetooth technology to identify individuals as they entered a building and then displayed targeted influence messages on a screen to persuade them to take the stairs instead of the elevator. The types of messages used were based on Robert Cialdini's six principles of influence:

1. **Commitment/Consistency**: Messages encouraged individuals to stick to a personal commitment to health by taking the stairs.
2. **Consensus/Social Proof**: Messages pointed out that many others in the building were taking the stairs, suggesting that the individual should follow suit.
3. **Authority**: Messages cited authority figures such as gym instructors or doctors to reinforce the benefits of taking the stairs.

Initially, messages were displayed at random, but over time, Kapitein analyzed which types of messages each individual responded to best by observing their behavior. With this data, he created persuasive profiles for each person, showing which strategy worked best for them. Subsequently, more targeted messages based on their persuasive profile could be used to influence their behavior more effectively.

The concept of persuasive profiling suggests that marketers, designers, and others looking to influence behavior should focus on individualized strategies based on past responses rather than one-size-fits-all approaches. By crafting a personalized profile, the likelihood of influencing future behavior increases.

In conclusion, persuasive profiling is a powerful tool for crafting communications and interventions that cater to an individual's known susceptibilities to influence strategies, ensuring a more predictable and successful outcome in persuading them towards a desired behavior.

In this video we're gonna talk about persuasive profiling and for this I will look at the work or talk about the work of Maurits Kapitein and after this video you should be able to explain the concept of persuasive profiling. So Maurits Kapitein when I think he defended his PSD thesis I think in Eindhoven had a nice proposition. I'm gonna read this and listen to it. Previous responses of an individual to an influencing attempt are more predictive for subsequent responses than the average response of others. Now think back for a moment to the previous videos where we're talking about Caldini with his six principles of influence. Now most research there is done on averages so one group and another group and we then try one principle and look what happens and then you see right on average you see this is a good principle. Kapitein thinks of it differently. He says yes on average these principles might work for the average person but what is actually more interesting in asking first what the average is, is to see that these principle what people would follow in the past. So as an individual would I if I were more acceptable for commitment or consistency than authority then the next time we try to persuade me again then if you know that I'm better in commitment and authority then the second time we could also try commitment yes so although it's difficult to understand you could go there for the average you could better individualize and look at how people reacted previously because there's a good predictor for the future for that individual now and that is you create therefore a profile for the individual. Now to explain his research helps a bit understanding what he was thinking or is thinking. So Kapitein what he did was an interesting experiment. He had a building and there was Bluetooth so he could recognize people coming in with the Bluetooth connection with a mobile phone so he knew all right that's Bob again coming in and then he did two things what he tried to do was to persuade people to take the staircases instead of the elevator and to do this what he had was a TV screen when you walk in the computer recognized you oh that's Bob coming in and he displayed a message on the screen and then he checked whether after you've seen this message you took the elevator or the staircases because he could see whether Bob based on his Bluetooth connection went up the staircases or took the elevator and that the next time Bob comes in he recognized because the same Bluetooth signal from the mobile phone so he could then start sending a specific message for Bob now what messages did he take now he took the messages basically from Caldini so he looked at commitment comes consistency and authority so commitment so the kind of messages he would then display are plan to become healthier start by taking a staircase so plan to blah blah blah is a commitment did you plan to be healthier now do this or commitment a committed to get in shape start by taking the staircase again did you make a commitment and you have to take the staircase and the last one promise yourself to be more physical active take the staircase again so this is all you make a commitment then you have to do this so that were his commitment messages he also had consensus message which is social proof yes 70% of the people in this building already taking the stairs what about you see the majority is doing it should you not also doing this the majority of people in the building take the staircase join them now see exactly the same message in a sense or follow many other people's take the staircase now did for his social proof kind of message or consensus authority the message is there where you get a good exercise by taking a staircase but Clarence Bake your gym instructor gym instructor is the authority about how to what to do to be healthy doctors recommend taking the stairs again the doctor the authority figure take the staircase to help you to shape up your buttocks Jessica the road your Zumba instructor yes the authority on this kind of thing yeah so and initially he just randomly put all these messages up yes so Bob comes in one day he sees a commitment the next day he might see a consensus now they see authority and he did a couple of time but then at the end and now it becomes interesting he looked at the profile of this individual see what did work with this when did he take the staircase or see when it was a commitment a consensual authority and then he says okay now I understand that the authority for this person or the commitment that is really working now we start sending commitment messages and see if that is really helping now here you see one graph of one individual for user 94 and you can see here for this is the consistency strategy you see the top line where the up one see over those six time you have the messages but the commitment is working now and that is basically making a persuasive profile you see for this person the commitment is working maybe for another one is authority but you have to learn it and because people work reacting in the past about did work respond in a good way when you send this kind of persuasive message you take that as an indicator for to persuade people in the future okay so to summarize persuasive profile learn from the past see what works in the past with persuasive strategy for that individual work and then use it to get a kind response you are desirable in the future and that in a nutshell is an persuasive profile I hope you enjoyed this video see you in the next one
