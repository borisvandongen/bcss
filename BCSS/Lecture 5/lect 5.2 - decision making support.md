### Summary of Lecture on Decision Making Support

**Introduction to Decision Making Support:**
- Importance: In behavior change, making informed choices is crucial as they have consequences on future behavior.
- Goal: To understand how people make decisions and explore how computers can provide decision-making support.

**Choice Patterns:**
- Decision-making often involves evaluating various options, which can be studied through human-computer interaction.

**Types of Research on Choice in HCI:**
1. Decision to use a system (influenced by technology acceptance theory).
2. Choice of methods to accomplish tasks (e.g., mouse vs. keyboard input).
3. Configuration decisions (e.g., screen color, volume settings).

**Human-Computer Interaction to Support Choices:**
- Focuses on using computers to assist with decision-making.
- Uses the Aspect model, which outlines six choice patterns.

**The Aspect Model - Choice Patterns:**
1. **Attribute-Based Choice:** Evaluate multiple attributes of options and weigh pros and cons.
2. **Social-Based Choice:** Consider reviews or friends' advice.
3. **Policy-Based Choice:** Follow a rule or personal policy (e.g., always buy Oxford dictionaries).
4. **Experience-Based Choice:** Use past experiences or emotional relationships to inform choices.
5. **Consequence-Based Choice:** Weigh the outcomes of different options.
6. **Trial and Error-Based Choice:** Learn through attempting and observing results.

**The ARCADE Model - Support Strategies:**
1. **Access Information and Experience (A):** Make accessing relevant information easier (information retrieval systems, live logging, social media, simulations).
2. **Represent the Choice Situation (R):** Visualize options and attributes (information visualization).
3. **Combine and Compute (C):** Help combine and perform computations for users (machine learning, clustering).
4. **Advice about Processing (A):** Provide recommendations on which pattern to use (conversational agents).
5. **Design the Domain (D):** Create adaptable interface designs, highlighting relevant options and impacts.
6. **Evaluate on Behalf of the Chooser (E):** Employ recommendation systems based on user history and preferences.

**Conclusion:**
The lecture explains the importance of decision-making support and introduces the Aspect model for pinpointing various choice patterns. The ARCADE model provides strategies on how computers can aid decision-making by improving access to information, representing choices clearly, combining data, offering processing advice, designing user-centered interfaces, and providing automated evaluations and recommendations.

**Next Steps:**
Students are encouraged to reflect on these models and consider how they can be applied in designing systems that support decision-making.

Decision making support in this video I want to look at choice patterns and support strategies to help you understand the type of way people can make choices. So the kind of patterns that they use for that and also how we can use computers to support people to make these choices. And making choices is important because in behavior change often people have to make choices that have a consequence on the kind of behavior they will exhibit after that. So it's good to have a system that can help people make the decisions that they want to do and make and that they don't make a wrong decision by error. Yes. So that's the reason why we're going to look at choice patterns. Okay, so if we look at computers and human-computer interaction often, there has been already some research about choices, but these choices are quite different. What type of choices that we do we start in human-computer interaction, for example. So one problem is the decision whether to use a system. Yes. So in previous videos, we talked about technology acceptance theory. That was a theory about what factors influence people to accept or start using an application. So that's also a choice. Another way that we do research on choice is if you look at a system, okay, in a system you have multiple methods that you can use to accomplish a task. So you could use your mouse to click on something, you maybe use the keyboard to do something. So there are different methods to do it. So we could study that which choice you use or users use to accomplish a certain subtask. Other research in human-computer interaction about a choice is about the configuration decisions. Do you want to use a blue screen, a green screen? Do I want to put up the volume loud or no volume? So these are different options that people do. So we also studied it. These are the traditional kind of human-computer interaction research questions. But here we want to talk about human-computer interaction or computers that you can use to support people's choice. And here I want to talk about Jason's, his aspect model. So aspect in this model is our six patterns, choice patterns. And these are heuristics or ways that people make decisions or choices in their everyday life. So let's have a look at them. And the example Jason is using to explain it is, imagine you are looking for a dictionary and you have to make the decision which dictionary you're going to buy. Yeah. Okay. Now one choice strategy is the attribute-based choice. So what you do is you identify the attributes that are relevant to judge or make a decision about the dictionary. And then you look at all those attributes, the levels of them, and you basically weight off the pros and cons based on those attributes. So you could have a Webster dictionary and an Oxford dictionary and another dictionary. And then you can look at the attributes. So how many words do they have? How easy is it to find something in the dictionary? And how expensive are they? Sort of different attributes. And then you can look at the plus and minus and based on that, you make a decision. Yeah. So that's the attribute-based choice pattern. Socially pattern. So what you can also do is to look at how other people judge the dictionaries. So you might read reviews or listen to your friends. Yes. So that is a kind of a social-based and therefore you need this information from others to make such a decision. And so you look like similar people like you make a decision in a similar situation. And so what do they recommend about these dictionaries? Policy-based choices. So people might sometimes have a policy and they see, all right, can I apply this policy? So my policy would be, I always buy Oxford dictionaries. Oh, now I've chosen a different dictionary. And this one is the German-French Oxford dictionary. So the policy is just to buy the Oxford dictionary. Yes. Now, that's another choice pattern. The experience-based choice. In experience-based choice, you can use your experience from the past to make a decision for the future. So it could be that people are primed. So I'm saying, all right, yes, I have to think about this. And if I look at a dictionary, I should look at the colors that are very good or whether that I should see how is the word handy kind of things, yes. Or it's an emotional relationship you might have with a particular product, yes. So it's just the past that you have this experience and that you're now using that. Consequence-based choice. So in this case, you're going to look like, what are the consequences if you do one or another choice? And based on the consequences, way up and down, you make a decision. Yes. So what are the consequences if I take an Oxford dictionary compared to a Webster dictionary? Maybe if I take the Oxford, then I have the whole set completed. And if I try once to sell a whole completed set as a small word, then I have different types of dictionaries and then I cannot sell them off later on. Yes. So that's maybe a consequence. Yeah. Now, then the trial and error-based choice here, you try a bit based on the experience you get. Did it work or not? That's the basis for your decision. So to make this possible, of course, you need to be able to have access to try it for yourself. So if it's not accessible, so I cannot look at the dictionaries, then I cannot make a trial and error kind of a choice. Yeah. Okay. Now, based on these choices, you can also look further and think about how can you support people when they need to make a decision. For this, the arcade model, Jameson suggests and his other authors on the paper. So let's look at them one by one. So the acronym stands for A for access information and experience, R for to support represents the choice situation, C stands for combining and computing the information, A is give advice about the processing, D design the domain itself and evaluate on the behalf of the chooser. All right, let's look at them in the details, but you can see also the pillars are also written down different kind of computer strategies that you can support that. Access and information experience. So a number of these patterns, attitude based, consequence based, experience based, they all depend on having access to information. So if you make that access to information easier, then you help the person to make that type of choice and decision. So the example he gave, there's an information retrieval system that helps to retrieve relevant information to make these choices. Live logging, so if you want an experience based pattern, then live logging help you to look at the past and say, all right, that's the experience in the past, so now I can make an informed decision. Social media, what do others think about it? So socially based decisions and simulations and games, then you can do consequent based. So you learn in the simulation what the consequences of that decision, yeah? But together, it's all about getting access to information which you need for a decision. Now let's move in and to the RK, then we get to the R, represent the choice situation. So sometimes it helps to visualize the choice situation because then people understand what is possible, yes? So information visualization can help there because sometimes it's very complex, but if you can make a clear visualization, then all of a sudden it becomes clear, oh, that are the options, yes? Oh, so I have these three dictionaries or these are the attributes that I can rate them on now they're nicely in a table and I see the pros and cons and I can easily make the comparison, yeah? So helping to represent what the choice situation is, is a way to support this kind of patterns. Let's move on, combined and compute. So here, again, you can put information together and do a little bit of a calculation for people. Sometimes that's needed. For attributes, you can filter information, make it easy to understand what the plus and the minus. Also remove the attributes that are maybe not so important. Now here you can use all kinds of strategies. You see here in the RK, clustering, you can machine your learning, diagnostic and predictions, all kinds of tools or techniques you can give users here to help them in combining and do computing of data, which is important for these different choice patterns. Advice about processing. Here you can give, the computer can advise a person which choice pattern might be smart to take. An example here is a conversational agent that can explain that to you. Design of the domain. We mentioned already before, you can visualize different results set, but you can also make that adaptable. And so you can have an adaptable interface, which has helped you to change the design of the system and to remove redundant choices and only fix the important things, make it easier to see the consequences. Now that is design the domain. Another way you can help people here is to evaluate it based on the chooser. So if I know already the type of evaluation pattern that you use, then I can do it on behalf of you. Yes. So a recommended system does this. So I know already in the past what your preference were and your selection. So now I can recommend it in a sense, choose for you. I think this movie is very good for you because I know you'll like this or your peers also like that. Yeah. So these are again techniques to help and to make such a choice. Now, that was a lot of things going on in this video. So on one side, we talked about the aspect model, about different choice patterns. We looked at six of them and in the arcade model, we looked at how, what way we can help with the computer system to help people make easier, easier to make those decisions. Okay. So I hope you enjoyed it and see you in the next video.
