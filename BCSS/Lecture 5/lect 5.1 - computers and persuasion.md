Summary:

**Persuasive Technology:**

- **Definition:** Interactive computer systems designed to change people's attitudes or behaviors.
  
- **Effectiveness:** Computers are used effectively in persuasion due to their consistency, anonymity, ability to process large amounts of data, use of multiple modalities, scalability, and ubiquity.

- **Levels of Persuasion:** There are macro levels, where the product's main intent is to persuade (e.g., a carbon footprint app), and micro levels, where elements within an application are designed to persuade (e.g., reminders to backup data in a word processor).

**Functional Triad:**

1. **Tools:** Computers enhance capabilities, making tasks faster, easier, or more effective. Techniques include:
   - Reduction (e.g., Amazon's one-click purchase)
   - Tunneling (e.g., Amazon's streamlined checkout)
   - Tailoring (e.g., Facebook's personalized experience)
   - Suggestion (e.g., text message prompts when crossing borders)
   - Self-monitoring (e.g., fitness trackers)
   - Surveillance (e.g., parental monitoring of internet use)
   - Conditioning (e.g., habit formation through rewards)

2. **Medium:** Providing experiences or simulations to persuade, such as:
   - Cause and effect simulations (e.g., showing effects of sugary drink consumption)
   - Environment simulations (e.g., VR simulations for sociophobia)
   - Object simulations (e.g., "baby think it over" dolls)

3. **Social Actor:** Computers act as social beings to engage users through psychological principles like:
   - Attractiveness (e.g., appealing avatars)
   - Similarity (e.g., virtual nurses that users feel similar to)
   - Praise (e.g., congratulatory messages for healthy behavior)
   - Reciprocity (e.g., sharing information with a virtual character)
   - Authority (e.g., computers representing authoritative figures)

In conclusion, persuasive technology uses the capabilities of computers to approach users in various ways to change their behaviors and attitudes, as tools, media, or social actors, utilizing different strategies and levels of persuasion.

Persuasive technology. In this video, I will be talking about persuasive technology and at the end of the video, you should be able to explain why we can use computers to persuade people. Why are they effective? And also we have an idea about the different levels. You could say, you can use computers to persuade people. And then I also want to talk about the functional triad and show all kinds of examples and principles of persuasion that you can put in technology. And you should be able, after this video, to explain these principles. Now, let's start talking about why using computers to persuade, why that is so effective. Now, you have to step back and before Fock introduced persuasive technology, at that time, people, when they look at computers, they were thinking about more task-oriented, complete something. So if you would look, for example, at Amazon, then you would say, all right, there you can place orders. And then on the other side, the server would pick up your order and process that and send it back to you. So it was more kind of an ordering system. Now, when Fock says, no, no, no, no, no, it's not just an ordering system. It's a system that attempts to persuade you to buy more books. That is the essence of Amazon, yes? To persuade you to sell or buy more books. Now, that's a completely different view. Before Fock's idea, we didn't look at computers as a mean to persuade people. And once they start turning around, seeing this like, ooh, we can use people to sell things or to persuade people to change their behavior. All of a sudden, technology became viewed in a complete different spotlight or view, yes. And we have seen already the definition that Fock used for persuasive technology. And they are interactive computer system designed to change people's attitude of behavior. And now, why is it so interesting to think about technology in this frame of persuasion? Now, if you look at Fock's book, he gives a number of examples where you have domains where you can use all kinds of technology to persuade people. So in commerce, selling stuff, you can try to sell more books or products like in Amazon. But you can also think of the domain of learning and teaching. Here, you can use the computer to engage more in a learning process and help them to change their skills and also their knowledge set. Safety is another domain where you can use technology. And you can have people experience what it is drinking drunk, some drunk driving simulator. Then you experience that you might always say, all right, I can still drive if I'm drunk. But now you see actually, and when you're sober, how poor your judgments actually is, could be if you're drunk, if the simulator simulates how your car would be responding in a sense. Now, multiple kind of domains and application are possible for using persuasive technology. Now, why again, so why is it so interesting? Now, let's go to a list and I want to talk about six. Six advantages if you compare a human persuasion, persuader and a computer as a persuader. Now, first one, the consistency. A computer can keep on asking you each time, it's patient and each time it asks. So take for example, GhostView, that's the application which you can use. And it's free, but each time if you open it, it asks you, do you want to register? Do you want to pay now? And you can say, no, I continue. Next time you use it, it comes again. Do you now want to register? No, you can do so. You keep on saying no, no, no. And one day you would say, all right, I register, yes? Now, imagine if you want to put a person there asking you, each time you use this kind of application, it comes in, do you want to register? You can maybe do it once or twice, or even not even possible, yes? So with a computer, you can be persistent. Keep on asking this question again and again. The computer doesn't get tired about it. And if you don't have time, you want to consider the next time, it's fine by the computer, yes? For humans, it's quite difficult to use this type of persuasion due to consistency. And other thing what computers are also very good in is offering anonymity, yes? So some topics are very difficult to talk about and you might be happy then to do it with a computer in a sense so no one knows about it. So think about all these mental health problems people might have, or things that you find a bit awkward to talk about, yes? Now, you can go and talk with a computer or search online where you find anonymously all kinds of information, yes? So by allowing this anonymity, the computer opens up a new kind of area where others with a human who tried to persuade to do it, the person might not contact the persuader. The computer may be easier. And other thing what the computer is also good in is to store, to access and manipulate a large amount of data, yes? So imagine normally you would go to your grocery shop and he knows a couple of people in the neighborhood, yes? But that's it. Yes, he might know a couple of people, the neighborhood, but not the whole town, not the whole nation. Now, a computer can have the capacity to use all this information and for each of them make a personalized kind of offer and start to learn what this person like or that person like, yes? And he can also see over a longer time what you did yesterday, week before that, maybe a year before that. And whoops, within seconds, he could analyze that. So you cannot compare that with the human persuaders. He doesn't have the capability. Maybe a few people he can learn and understand, but these amounts are large scales. Computer are a definite advantage there. What computers also can do is use multiple modalities to communicate with people, yes? So they can use text, video, virtual reality. They can use YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, all kinds of things, but still it's a computer behind it, all different channels and modalities to reach out to you. Now, that's very handy and convenient what a computer can do. Another point why the computer is so interesting is the scalability, yes? With computers, once you solve a certain task or make it possible, you can scale it up and offer this services to many people, yes? So again, if you have a grocery shop here next door, it's very difficult, say, all right, now I want to scale this up to, all right, on a national level or maybe for whole Europe, yes? With computers, you have this ability to scale up. So that's also an interesting advantage. And computers can be ubitrix. So it could be in different places, yes, where a human persuader might be limited to what kind of access he has. And maybe on the street, he could see a person or in the shop, but it's very difficult for a person to get into someone's home and try to sell there or lay in bed with a person. But that's exactly what the computer is doing, yes? You might be still looking at your mobile phone, sitting at the couch, looking at television, and there, all kinds of persuasive elements in a very, yeah, fabric of life of a person, all kinds of elements are there where you could reach out to a computer, to a person. So that's also a lot of possibilities. Now, levels of persuasion is also an interesting thing to think about. So Fox says, basically, you have a macro and a micro level of persuasion. So what does he mean with it? So with the micro, he means the whole intention of the product is to persuade, yes? So think about, if you have an example, here is a product for a carbon footprint. So the whole application is to reduce your carbon footprint, yes? So persuasion is the main intent behind the application. Micro persuasion level means that the application might not have the intent to change you. For example, it's a word processor, but there are elements in the application that try to persuade you. For example, make sure you make a backup on time, or maybe rate elements on how much you love it or something, or hate something, yes? So there are small elements in the application that use persuasive strategies, but the whole intent of the application might not be to persuade you. Now, that are the different things. So, and that makes it interesting because most applications, somewhere there is something you try to persuade. And you can still use all these ideas that we hear talking about in these videos. But, of course, most of the thing what people are thinking of when they think about persuasive technology, behavior change support system, are the macro levels kind of applications. Okay, now we talked about the computer already, how we can use it. And Fock also put forward the functional triad. So if you look at the functional triad, it gives you an idea about in what manner we can use a computer to persuade. And he says there are three kind of ways of doing it. It is like a tool, so it increased the capability of a person and make something faster or easier or more effective. So then it's like a hammer and a nail kind of thing. You can do something. Another way where you can use a computer is as a medium. So the medium provide a person with an experience. People change because of the experience they have. So this way you use persuasion by giving people experiences. Now, the last in that functional triad is the social actor. So the computer can also position itself as if it were a person, so a social actor. Because he is a social actor or it is a social actor, it can then also try to elicit certain social psychological responses. So the way you would normally respond to another person, you would now respond to the computer, yes? So creating this relationship, triggering this same kind of relation that you normally and way you would interact with a person, you can now use that with a computer. Now, let's look at it in a bit more detail when I talk about it. Let's start with the tools. So tools, there are a number of techniques that we can use or principles, Fox calls them. And let's start with one, reduction. So reduction means I can make a task simpler. By using a computer to make things simpler, I might be more convinced of doing it because all right, the barrier is lower, it's easy to do. Now, clear example is the one-click button in Amazon, yes? Instead of you think, oh God, I have to fill in the form, a credit card, everything. No, just one button you press and you've bought it, yes? Make it very easy to buy something. And the other example here is organ donor chip, yes? Within two minutes, you can register yourself as a donor. Yes, make it very simple. You just click here, fill in the thing, done, yes? So instead of think, all right, I have to write a letter, send it to the post, do all kinds of forms. Here, two minutes, done, you're a donor. Now, people then might easily be persuaded to do it because the barrier's gone. Okay, another one, a principle of tunneling. So tunneling is using technology to guide a user through a process or take him along and during this process, you have opportunity of also persuasion. Now, the classic example we always give is Amazon. So Amazon, if you look for books, is always fine, and products, but as soon as you decide, all right, I want to buy something, then you might notice something really changes because when you're still exploring and looking for things, there are all kinds of options, and things, and books, and films. As soon as you say, I'm gonna buy it, you see all this is removed and Amazon helps you quickly through this process. He wants to make sure that you, in a sense, make that buy, and try to reduce all kinds of diversions or things that might stop you, think, oh, maybe I have to think something else, yeah? So he tunnels you through this process. Now, that can help. Another way of looking at tunneling is sometimes there's nothing else to do. So in the past, often, if you have to download a thing, you have to install, you have sometimes to wait and look at your screen. Now, at that moment, there's no way where you can go, and then you can send people messages, say, oh, did you think about this new kind of feature in the application? Have you considered that? So again, you are tunneled because you have to go through this process, and in the tunneling, persuasion is possible. Tailoring is another principle, yes? So by providing information which is specifically tailored to an individual, needs, interest, and personality, become much more relevant to a person, and if it is relevant, yes, it might be interesting to listen to it, yes? So if you think about Facebook, it's all about this personalization, it's about your friends, your story, your life. Yes, it's not something general, so the more persuasive element is there that it is all personalized information to you, for you, yes, and makes it interesting. So tailoring is there for this element that you really make this information that is tailored to the individual. Now, suggestion is also an interesting one. Excuse me for, it's a Dutch example, but I explain this. So the principle here is the persuasive power, so of the right opportune moment. So if the computer knows, this is the moment to put forward this suggestion, it's a like, the chance is higher that you actually would respond. Now, the example here, if you cross the border, and then you get all these text messages from, all right, do you know? And now, if you want to use your mobile phone, that you need to pay so much or so much, and are you interested to maybe look for a certain reduction or something, yeah? So knowing that the person crossed the border is an opportune moment to start talking about this kind of stuff. There's no point doing that before you cross the border because who cares? But as soon as you come to another country, that's an opportune, interesting moment. Now, you can think of more of these things when the computer knows, all right, here's something happening, now is a good moment to ask. Now, that is also the right moment for a suggestion. Self-monitoring is also a principle you can do. So the computer can be used to help you to monitor yourself, yes? So it's quite difficult to monitor yourself, like if you want to keep track about your finance, if you have to write it down each time, but if a computer can do it, all right, I spent the money there and there, hmm, maybe I should use less, go less shopping in the evening or buying all this expensive stuff, yeah? So if there's this monitoring overview, it helps you to become aware of what you're doing, where you spent your money, but that could also be how many steps you're taking, yes? So if you have a tracker, a monitor, you could see, oh, I take a lot of steps, but maybe in Saturday and Sunday, I don't do that much, yes? So it will help you to become aware, and then people change and say, all right, maybe I should also do a little bit of walking on the Saturday and Sunday, yeah? Surveillance, that's another principle. And surveillance allows you, instead of you doing the monitoring, it's someone else who's doing the monitoring, yes? And now, that can help if you know that you're being monitored, all right, you might also change your behavior. So the easy examples, if you, for example, try to stop drinking alcohol, hey, if you, alcohol addiction, you could use application that tracks you when you start drinking alcohol and warn other people to help, whoa, Bob is starting to drink again or he's going nearby in place like a pup. Other way of tracking is to think, for example, parents that track their children on what they're doing on internet, so they are aware that they might go to sites which maybe a bit too young for. Another thing is conditioning, and we talked about already in the hook model, so we can use computers to reinforce and condition, when they do something, give the reward. So these kinds of things can, a computer can actually do to create these habits. Okay, so that was one of the functional triad, that was the tools, but as Fok said, you can also use it as a medium. And for example, in a medium, you can show people what you have a simulation, a cause and effect relation. So most of the time, we learn by running around in the world and we do stupid things, and then we learn, buff, that's the effect, that's the result, so a cause and effect. A computer, can you allow you to see this in a simulated situation? So example, here's the example, what is the effect if you drink a lot of calorie sugary drinks? Then you can show over time, over the months, what will happen to your body, yes? So now people see this, all right, if I do this, this will be the effect. Now, in a simulation, you can show that, but another simulation could be also, for example, when you want to buy clothes and you go online, instead of you go to the shop where you take it on, and you say, all right, this shirt looks nice, you can do it also online and you put your own avatar there and put different clothes on it, so you see what happens to you as a whole person if you put these clothes on, so it's a cause and effect relationship. Another way where you can use a medium is to simulate an environment. So think about virtual reality, you can go to an environment and practice something. So here in Delft, we did a lot of research on sociophobia, so people go into a virtual world and practice all kinds of social situation, but you could also practice, for example, public speaking, doing a presentation. And what you could also do in this virtual environment is to reward people, if they do something fun, then maybe they can experience something what is nice, yes? So they can practice, rehearse things, but can also get virtually a reward, you could say. Now, instead of a virtual world, you can also use computers as a simulated object, and one that people can practice things or experience things in the normal environment. Now, a nice example is a baby think it over. So people who are quite young and are considering taking a baby and want to have a baby, they might not know the consequences, what it means to be a parent. So baby think it over is a simulated baby, doll, yes, a puppet, and what you could say for teenagers who might consider becoming a parent, you say, all right, if you really want to understand what it is to be a parent, here you have this simulated baby, take it along for a week and then come back. Now, this baby will start crying in the middle of the night, keep you awake. So after a week, you will have a bit of more attention, what it is to be a parent and take care of a child who might in the middle of the night also need attention, sleep would be very nice, all these kinds of different things. But then at least you get an experience and you can talk much more with kind of more insight of what this is if you take that decision. So that's also a simulation, but then a whole object, so you don't go to a virtual world, but the object itself is in the real world. Now, the third corner of the triad was using a computer as a social actor. So now we treat, in a sense, the computer as if it were a person or an animal, but it's social, so you could interact with it. And then you can use all kinds of classical psychological principles that work when you consider a social actor. So attractiveness, which is also important with humans, is also important for virtual worlds or computers. So attractive computers or avatars, yes, they get more attention. Another way is similarity. Yes, if we are more open to people who are similar to ourselves, and more persuaded by that, and that we also find in technology, so Bickmore and his group studied how people react to nurses. And they first thought that for the skin color, and that with a match would be more persuasive, but when they did the study, didn't find it. What they did find that was interesting. They asked people how similar they thought they were to the virtual nurse. And the more they rated the similarities higher, the more persuaded they were by this nurse. Yes, so our trust and desire to continue to work with the work alliance, so it's not persuasive, but different elements. But again, it was not just simply, they look similar, so therefore I trust them and desire to continue with it. It's more like I feel similar to this virtual character. And praise, as a human, I can persuade you, other humans, by giving them praise, that helps. But the computer can also do this. So for example, we have done studies here in Delft where we had a character. If you did something well, you did the running or eating well, and it says, all right, congratulations, done very well, yes? Now, people then also continue much more to keep on trying to reduce weight and eat more healthy. Yes, so the praising is also helping. And you see it on computers, and you see the thumbs up and this kind of thing, well done, praise again. And reciprocity, so you do something, and because you do something, I do something for you, yes? That we do often in a normal social setting. You give me something, I give you something, yes? It's a bit of a social contract that we have with each other. Now computers, we do it also with computers, strangely enough, yes? And so one example here, if the character was disclosing more information about itself, people were also disclosing more information about itself, yes? So you think, oh, the computer tells something about myself, itself? Now then people would also tell a bit more about itself. Yeah, so again, you have the same kind of principle. Authority, we also talk much more about this principle in another video, but authority is also a persuasive strategy that you use by humans. So if a police officer or your doctor, so someone in an authority position says something to you, it's more persuasive. Now, if you make the computer look like he's also speaking on behalf of a certain authority, people are also more likely to follow this advice. Okay, to summarize. So I talked about a lot in this video. And so we talked about the advantage of using a computer, yeah, so these are very persistent. They can allow anonymity. They have a huge amount of data that they can process and they have different modalities. They can reach you as a human. They can scale to large scale. They can communicate with loads of people and ubiquitousness. They could be in all kinds of places and shapes. Now, we also talked about the levels. You could have a whole application with the intentions to persuade people or to change their behavior, or you have element. And we talked about the micro level, element in the application to try to persuade you. Then we talked about the functional triad. So computers, we can see it as a tool to try to persuade you. You can see them as a social actor. So you get the same kind of rapport that you would have with a normal human, this kind of similar social reactions, or as a medium. The computer allows you to experience something and that makes you change. Okay, I hope you enjoyed this video. See you in the next one.
