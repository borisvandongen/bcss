Summary of Lecture 5: Persuasive Technology

In Lecture 5, we delve into the concept of persuasive technology, which explores the use of technology to influence human behavior, attitudes, and motivation. By the end of this lecture, students will learn about:

1. Persuasive Strategies: The lecture will cover psychological and social strategies that can be employed to persuade individuals effectively.

2. Technological Support for Persuasion: It will discuss how these persuasive principles can be executed or supported through various forms of technology, such as websites and mobile phones.

3. The Fogg Behavior Model: Also known as the functional triad, this model created by B.J. Fogg categorizes how computers can fulfill three roles—as tools, media, or social actors—in the context of persuasion.

4. Decision Support Systems: The lecture aims to shed light on decision-making processes and how decision support systems (DSS) can aid these processes to facilitate better outcomes.

5. Captology: The term, originated by B.J. Fogg in 1997 at Stanford, represents the overlap between psychology and technology, which he describes as the ability to capture attention and engage users to promote behavioral change through technological means.

Through the course material in this lecture, students will gain an understanding of how digital interfaces can be designed to alter human behavior and influence decision-making in a variety of contexts.

## Transcript

Welcome, this is lecture 5. In this video, a short introduction to this lecture. In this lecture, we're going to look at persuasive technology. Persuasive technology, here we look at how we can use technology to persuade people. So after this lecture, you should be able to consider a number of psychological social strategies that can be used to persuade a person, and how we could then use also technology to support these persuasive principles. And I also want to look at the frictional triad, and see how a computer can be used in different ways to support persuasion. And finally, I'm also going to look at decision support systems, so how do people make decisions and how can we again support this. In this video, I will be talking a lot about Peter Fock. So in 1996, no, in 1997, at Stanford, he put forward this idea of persuasive technology, where you see the psychology behind persuasion, how do you make behavior change, change people's attitudes, motivation, this kind of thing. And on the other side, technology, how can you use websites, mobile phones, and if you overlap that, he calls it captology, or you could say persuasion, so how could you capture with technology people to persuade them to change their behavior, attitude, motivation. And that we're going to look at this video, or this lecture, so I hope you enjoy it. See you along in the videos.
