### Summary of Nudging Theory

**Definition:**
Nudging Theory, also known as "Nuts Theory" or "Nutting," is an approach developed by Richard Thaler (Nobel Prize laureate) to influence individuals' behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. The key is to make it easy for people to make the desirable decision.

**Illustrative Story:**
Thaler used a bowl of nuts at a party to demonstrate this concept. Initially, guests would overeat nuts when they were easily accessible and then feel too full to enjoy dinner. By simply moving the nuts further away, guests ate fewer nuts and subsequently had an appetite for the meal. This showed that small changes in the environment (location of the nuts) could influence behavior without removing freedom of choice.

**Application:**
Nudging is about creating stimuli in the environment that guide people toward making wise decisions:
- In a salad bar, if healthy food is presented first and is more accessible, people are more likely to fill their plates with it and may skip less healthy options that come after.
- The unhealthier options are not removed; they are just placed less conveniently.

**Choice Architecture:**
A "choice architect" is someone who designs these environmental structures. They set up defaults, knowing that people tend to stick with default options rather than actively changing them. Experiments have shown people often consume more when given larger default portions (popcorn) or eat indefinitely if the supply seems endless (soup experiment with hidden tube refilling).

**Default Options:**
Defaults are powerful because people often "mindlessly" follow them. They are central to nudging as they set the path of least resistance, influencing behavior while still allowing individuals to choose otherwise if they wish.

**Experiment Example:**
An experiment with different interface settings for self-managing health at home showed that even if users expressed a preference for one type, majority did not switch from the default option provided to them.

**Conclusion:**
Nudging aims to subtly guide people toward making beneficial choices without coercion and while maintaining all possible options. It emphasizes the design of the default setting and the arrangement of choices to facilitate smarter decision-making while respecting individuals' freedom to choose.

Remember, a good nudge makes it simple to do "the right thing," but never removes the freedom to choose otherwise.

Nuts theory, that's what I want to talk about in this video. After this video you should be able to explain nuts theory. So nuts theory, or nutzing, sometimes people talk about, is from Richard Taylor. He's quite famous now because he got for this idea the Nobel Prize. And to explain nuts theory, Richard often put forward his story about the bowl of nuts that he put on a table in a party that he had at his home. So people came to his house and so he served some bowl of nuts he put on the table. And people were eating and taking those nuts. And then he would serve food, but people would feel, yeah, I'm stuffed, I ate all the nuts. So then he did a bit of things, the next part he did, he instead of putting the bowl right in front of the people with all the nuts, he put it a little bit far away on the table. And now people had a bit big effort to grab it. And then when he served food, people were not full, they were already still interested in eating the dinner. Because they hadn't stuffed themselves with all the nuts. That's interesting because, yes, the position where the nuts are determined whether people would eat something. And if you look at it from a rational economic purpose, you often say, all right, it's better to give all these opportunities that you have more choices. But he started to question whether that is always the smartest thing. Should you maybe in a sense not always have so many options, but maybe start restricting options? Because that might be better for people here. The example with eating the nuts, trying to restrict the access to the nuts was in a sense for the long term, better for an individual because then they had the full enjoyment of the whole dinner instead that they're already full because of the nuts he ate or they ate before. Now, take it one level higher. So nudging in a sense is a kind of a stimuli in the environment that guide people in making wise decisions. So instead of forcing people to do something, you guide them to do something. What you think as the designer of a setting is smart, what people should do wise or in a sense you want them to do. So the salad bar or food bar is a typical example. If you want people to eat healthy, then you make sure that the healthy food is much more accessible and easier when you come in than the unhealthy food. So what you do if you entered the food bar, you put all the healthy stuff in front of you, you put it on your plate. And later, when you come to the unhealthy things, you already have your plate full with healthy stuff. And then you don't, maybe less interested in the unhealthy thing. So imagine what you do, you turn it around. So if you turn it around, you come into the food bar and then first you see all the unhealthy food. You say, oh, that's interesting, fill your plate. And then later you come to the unhealthy food, then your plate is already full, yes? So by organizing the environment in a way that you are more exposed to the stimuli that is more wise and favorable, you influence a person by doing the wise thing. Yes. Now, interesting here is the idea of nudging is that he's not saying remove the fast food or the unhealthy food. No, you place it at a location which is a little bit more difficult to get access to. And that's a smart strategy. And a strategy is what you often refer to as a choice architect. So think about it. You see this often in politics. Yes. So you have the libertarian who want to have freedom of choice and do everything they like. And then you have the more paternalistic, which try to tell you what you should do because that is smart. Yes. Now, often these two ideas, they are fighting with each other. You don't, if you give all these kinds of rules, then people say, look, I'm not living in any state. Why is the government telling me what to do? But if you allow all things to happen, that people can do everything, then you get maybe a very chaotic situation that people might be unhealthy or taking risk behaviors now. So with this nudging, they argue there's a kind of a third way. Instead of saying it is one, you should have all the options to do, or we should control and limit the things what are dangerous, you say, all right, I'll trick it, make it more attractive to do the things what is wise, but I'm not withholding things what I think is not smart you should do, you can still do. So the idea is you make it much interesting and easy to do the right thing, then people would more accept such a choice or a decision. Because if you take something away, people would be upset. They say, oh, hang on, I want my pizzas or something. Not that I can eat them because I see here the healthy stuff. But if you take something away, then people might resist this idea. So with nudging, the idea is that you allow the both options are still there, but this one is much easier to take than the not that healthy one. So that's the idea. Now, the choice architect is also thinking about the default option, because what is the default option is important, because most people don't change the default. They mindlessly follow the kind of architectural setting what the default is. And there are a couple of very interesting experiments that they've done. So with popcorn, put it in different sizes. And just making the bigger, the larger, people ate much more popcorn. They didn't think about it. They ate until everything was empty. Yes. When the bag was empty. And they even have a more extreme experiment there where they had some people eating a soup. But in the bottom of the table, they had a tube and they could endlessly pour in more soup. So people were just eating, eating, eating, eating. And you would think you would stop when you feel full or you're not hungry. But people know because there's food in front of them. They keep on doing this. Lots of things. This is the default thing. You empty your plate. Now here, important message is people just follow normal routines. Yes. The default. So if you determine what the default is, you have the large majority following it. But you still allow people to say, I don't want it. Yes. So again, this nudging, make sure what is easy is the default. This is the thing you wanted as a choice like that to happen. But you don't remove the other option. It's still possible. I could stop eating soup or the popcorn. We also used that idea in one of our experiments where people self-management at home, their own health. And we asked people that two types of interfaces. One which was more guided, help you to do things. And one was more, more factual information. Now the interesting thing, what we did, we asked people when they experiment with this, which were the preferred kinds of style. Was it the guided style or the factual style? And then in the next stage of the experiment, we allowed them to say, all right, now you can switch whatever you like. And then we looked whether people actually changed to their preferred style. But only in 36 of the cases, people actually switched the interface when it was not in their preferred style. But the larger majority just kept the interface in the way they, all right, the default that we gave them in the start of the condition. Yes. So think about it. If you create a system, what the default settings are, because large majority will not change the default setting. Now that's interesting. If you want to change people's behavior, make sure that the default therefore is in alignment to what you want to help them to change that behavior. However, you still allow them to change it. If they don't like it, they can change the default. Okay. Now, to summarize, nudging, the idea is you stimulate the environment that guides people to make wise and smart decisions. Important is the default, because what you say, people might make choices. They just follow what is in front of them in the sense of the default. And you try to afford non-force compliance. Yes. You offer the one what you think is wise, but you don't take away what you, you leave it, but you make it a bit more difficult to do the other one. And still then leave, is a decision to make. That's the important thing. Okay. So I hope you enjoyed this video and understand a little bit more about the nudging theory. See you in the next video.
