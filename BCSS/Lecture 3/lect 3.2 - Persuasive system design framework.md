Title: Summary of the Persuasive System Design (PSD) Framework

**Definition**: The PSD framework is a methodology used for designing behavior change support systems, which is commonly referred to in literature. It provides a structured approach to creating systems that can effectively influence user behaviors.

**Phases of PSD**:
1. **Understanding Key Issues**: Identify the essential characteristics of persuasive systems:
   - Persistent IT presence
   - Consistency and user commitment requirements
   - Direct and indirect influence methods
   - Incremental progress towards behavior change
   - Openness to new ideas
   - Unobtrusiveness
   - User-friendliness and utility

2. **Analyzing Persuasive Context**: Examine three main elements:
   - **Intent**: Identify the persuader and the type of change sought (compliance, behavior, or attitude).
   - **Event**: Understand the user context, including the social environment, existing usage patterns, and technology interaction.
   - **Strategy**: Develop messaging and routines that will encourage the desired behavior change.

3. **Designing System Qualities**: Determine how to support the intended persuasion through system features:
   - **Task Support**: Focus on the core actions the user needs to perform.
   - **Dialogue Support**: Use application communication to guide and motivate the user.
   - **Credibility**: Ensure the system is trustworthy and perceived as knowledgeable by the user.
   - **Social Support**: Leverage social networks and norms to reinforce the behavior change.

The PSD framework also provides detailed strategies, such as personalization, self-monitoring, praise, rewards, reminders, and suggestions, to strengthen the persuasive power of the system across different areas of support.

**Conclusion**: The PSD framework involves understanding the foundational elements of persuasive systems, analyzing the context for persuasion, and designing system qualities that enhance the system’s ability to effectively promote behavior change. The framework’s strategies include a variety of features that can support the primary task, foster a supportive dialogue, boost system credibility, and utilize social influence to facilitate behavior change.

Persuasive system design framework. So in this video I want to look at another method or framework for designing behavior change support systems from Ognias Koukoukan. And it will explain the different steps and issues you might look at, but also he is more suggesting ways of doing the persuasion. So after this video you should be able to explain the persuasive system development framework, so PSD. Okay, let's look at this. So you have different phases, as you also have three phases when developing it. So the first phase is understanding the key issues behind the persuasive system. Second phase is analyzing the persuasive context. And the last phase is designing the system qualities. Now you see here similarities with the other methods that we've seen before. But persuasive system development is also a common framework people are referring to in the literature. Okay, so understanding the key issues behind persuasive systems is... So he gives seven points that you have to consider. So for example, IT, the computer system, is always on. So it's always there to influence people or asking people if they need support. It's consistent and you require also commitment of people. And you can use them in different ways to influence them. Direct, for example, can help them more indirectly. Incremental, little steps that you help you. It's not you solve everything in one day. So every day you give a little bit of help and building up the whole behavior. Open, so you can share other ideas. And unobtrusive and useful and easy to use. Now these are kind of elements behind persuasive system design. Now let's move also to the second phase. And that was analyzing the persuasive context. It's the intent, the event and the strategy. So the intent, we already saw this in Wendel when defining the problem. So who is the persuader and what is the change type? So in the first lectures we talked about that. The change type, is it a compliance, is it a behavior or an attitude that we try to change? Then the event itself, you have to understand the use, the context that people are working in. Or doing this activity. The user's context, so his social network, their friends or family. So that we talked about it when we talked about, for example, creating these personas. And the technology, so what kind of technology applications are already using. So that is helping you to understand the event itself, where the persuasion has to take place. Then the strategy, so the message and what kind of routine you will start to build. Now that's the thing when you're analyzing the persuasive context. If you put it together and you get this big table that Unesco concaves. Then the persuasive design features. So one step aside, you have the persuasive context, the intent, the events, the strategy. And then there are opportunities how you can achieve this. So we have the primary task support. So what people really need to do and the action itself. So eating healthy, doing the running around, these kind of, so that's the primary task. But you can also have dialogue support. So maybe the application is talking to you to do the primary task, to understand how to do it. Another important thing you recognize is the credibility of the support. How much credible do people believe that the system can actually do this support? Yes, if they have no trust in it, they will not use this application. Also another part with help for the persuasion is the social support. So how is this person operating in his social network? Who can influence this person? Now let's look at the figure and you see for each of those primary support, dialogue support, credible support, there are different things to do. Reducing, tunneling, tailoring, personalization, self-monitoring. Now there's a whole list of strategies where you make things more persuasive. Later in other lectures, we go to all these individual things. But it's good that in this thing is list how you could help the primary support task. The dialogue, it says, all right, maybe the dialogue could give praise. You did it well or rewards, you get points, reminders. By the way, you should start working today of now or suggestion. I think you should eat this or suggest. All these kinds of things you can do for if you are in a dialogue with a person. Now credibility, how do you improve the trustworthiness or the show that you are of expertise or just the surface credibility? Does the application itself look kind of reliable? It's already important to look and feel who's the authority behind the information that is given in this kind of tool that you're building. Now these are kind of things that helps to improve this credibility of the system now. So support, social learning, can they learn from other people? Is there a comparison? Can they compare how they do compare to others? Is there kind of a norm like your whole peer group have an idea what you should do? So you have a kind of a social peer group norm that you have to follow and they influence you. Now more and more ideas there. Now that's what the PSD is giving you. Okay, so to summarize again. There are three big steps, phases in PSD. Understanding the key issues behind the persuasive system. Then analyzing the context of the persuasion. And then looking at the system, the quality the system can have to do the persuasion. And the design of these system qualities. You can look at what can they do to improve the primary task or the shield around us. The communication, the dialogue to support this primary task. How could you improve the credibility of the system? And also how can you use the social support that is so important for people to start changing their behavior? Okay, so that was it for this video. See you in the next one.
