Summary:

The lecture focuses on the 'Defining the Problem' stage, which is the first step in the DECIDE process model. It draws content from chapters 6 and 7 of a book by someone named Wendell.

Key Points:

1. Product Vision:
   - The vision communicates what the product or system is intended to do.
   - The vision aligns with the company's mission statement.
   - It guides the project direction and ensures team alignment.

2. Target Outcome:
   - Defines what changes in the user or environment are expected after using the product.
   - It should be concrete, observable, measurable, and avoid vague states of mind.

3. Formulating Outcomes:
   - Consider 'which type', 'where', 'what', and 'when' questions to specify the goal.
   - Prioritize outcomes if there are multiple, and it's essential to focus on concrete, observable actions.

4. Company Objectives:
   - For company-centered goal setting, align the product vision with company objectives, translating them into user outcomes.
   - Identify organizational constraints, including channels, budget, timeframe, tone, and target audience.

5. Defining Actions:
   - Create a list of actions or behaviors leading to the desired outcome.
   - Consider various strategies and scenarios that could lead to achieving the outcome.

6. Selecting an Action:
   - Evaluate possible actions based on their impact, motivation, ease, and cost.
   - Score these actions and focus on the most promising one.

7. Describe the Target Action:
   - Write a statement that outlines who the actors are, what actions they will take, and the anticipated outcome.

8. Minimal Viable Action:
   - Determine the simplest version of the target action to test if the product concept works, focusing on crucial behaviors.

9. Hypothesis for Behavior Change:
   - Develop a hypothesis about the intended behavior change based on the minimal action.

After reviewing these key points, students should have a clear product definition, comprehending the product's vision, objective outcomes, and hypotheses for behavioral change. This provides a foundation for the next steps in designing a behavior change support system.

## Transcript

Okay, defining the problem. This lecture or video is about the first letter of the DECIDE process model. So the D is defining the problem and we were looking at the material that is described in chapter 6 of the new edition of Wendell's book and we also will look a little bit of chapter 7 exploring the context. The main chunk of this video is about chapter 6. So after this video you should be able to define the problem that you will be working on when you develop a behavior change support system. And that's what we're going to look at now. Let's dive into this. So the first step in defining the problem is to define the vision of the product. So what is this product or system you're going to build be able to do. And this clarifying statement helps to that everyone outside but also in your project team understands what you are building. So and for this you could use often the mission statement of the company which says the framework of the kind of products that you would be inclined to build. Now let's look at one mission statement that you could look at. So the Sunlight Foundation is a non-profit non-partisan organization that uses the power of the internet to catalyze great governmental openness and transparency and provide new tools and resources for media citizens to alike. Yes so that is the mission what the company tries to achieve. Now you can move then this could help you as a kind of a frame which you could operate in to start developing your own product vision. Now let's pick one as an example. Allows anyone to uncover levels of influence in the federal and state level politics and the news coverage of it. Yes so your product will do this. It help people to understand how these they can influence the political landscape. Okay so this is really you as example of Randall. But you could come up with different types of visions what your project would do. So improve fitness of young city dwellers, democratize access to the financial guidance, inform public about cross powers on money in politics. So try to define the vision of your product which helps really that people know all right we're going that direction and not that direction because that could be very confusing if you want to work together on something. Now once you have that the really crucial part you then have to do is to define the target outcome. What would happen if people have used your product for maybe five weeks. What would change in the to the person or the environment. That is your outcome that you have to define because then you know what you try to achieve. Yes so what is different could be the environment that might be more healthy more or less air pollution or the person itself. Maybe it's a lost weight or is more active runs more. Yes and it also gives you an indication what is a failure when you didn't achieve that that you know that your product fails in a sense what it should deliver. Yeah so another example Californians will have an average body mass index of 24. Very clear if after five weeks they use your stuff you could measure the BMI and see if they changed or lost the 24 points on average. Yeah now what you should avoid when I'm saying is to be very vague about it. Experience exercises. What the hell does that mean? Is one walk? Is that experience exercises? Done a marathon? Yes so that makes really a large scope and then some project member thinks all right we're working here to get someone doing a marathon. But the other part is like all right maybe in five weeks they have done one walk in the park. Yes now you can already see that's a major distinction. Yeah so be concrete. Are you talking about a marathon? Three walks in the park? Yes make sure you understand also what Wendell suggests avoid state of mind kind of things. So say people are happy. How would you know that they are happy? How would you observe it? How do you know it? If you come in five weeks after they bought your application into their office and say oh I didn't have it or not. Yeah so he says try something which you can observe as an outsider. That makes it easier for everyone. Of course there are exceptions to the rule if you think about it. Because if you might be working in mental health then maybe the mental health is definitely what you want to achieve. In these cases you might consider using standardized measures or questionnaire instruments they have. But at least with some if you use this questionnaire you say right if you measure before and after five weeks we do the same measure instrument then we see 20 point reduction on this scale. At least as an outsider I could see this change. But in some cases don't go too quickly for this kind of standardized measurements. Because if you take depression for example there might be behaviors that you can observe which indicate more or less depression. Yes are people isolating themselves or are they going to more social activities? Yes um this might be an interesting indicator that your product is working. Yes yeah so maybe it's really that you need a standardized questionnaire kind of things because the setting you work in. But if not Wendell's clearly suggesting make it concrete observable and not too vague. Yeah that people could easily agree whether you achieve it or not. Now to help formulating this outcome Wendell suggests to consider a couple of questions. Which type, where, what and when? So which type of exercises? Is it the walk in the park, swimming, playing tennis or something? Be concrete which type you're talking about. Where? So is it here in Delft that you're targeting the population? Or is it in Japan, Europe? I don't know. So be concrete. Then you know at least which group you're targeting, which physical location. What should you actually do? What should change? So is it the decrease in air pollution? Is it the body mass intake? So what is actually changing? And when? Is it in three days, five weeks? How much time does your project have to achieve that? So be clear about that one. So if you put it together you get already a kind of clearer formulation of what your project is trying to achieve. Like here this project should decrease, cause a decrease in a nitrogen level and environmental pollutants. So that's the type of thing you try to do in the Netherlands over the next five years. All right, now you have an idea what you try to achieve. Could be a couple of problems sometimes that you sitting down and people want multiple outcomes. And so Wendell then say, all right, one way out of this to prioritize these different outcomes. So is it walking or is it physical activity? Is it quitting smoking? Is it healthy eating? It all helps to live healthily. But which one do we put on the highest top of the list? Assuming that if you achieve this, the others will come naturally itself. Yeah. And then he said, then focus on the highest. Another one is maybe there are two very competing things. Then he might say, all right, let's put both them in your statement. But he says that's a less preferred option. What you should not do at this state is how people should achieve this. So how would they achieve that after five months are capable of running the marathon? Yes. I know it's difficult because it's already easy for us to start thinking about, all right, then they should do weekly, daily walking and running and exercises. And you start talking about how they should do. Not relevant at this moment. Just say what they should be capable after five months. Yes. Sometimes it's a bit difficult to say how much. So how much should they lose weight or how much walks in the park should they take? But do just a rough ballpark estimation at some cases. That's already good enough because you need at least now, are we talking about one walk in the park or a hundred? Yes. Then you have a bit of a range where there is a hundred or a hundred to one. That's less relevant at this point. Okay. From now, we only talked about the kind of user-centered goal setting. What should the user achieve? But of course, often people are working in a setting of an organization and the organization might have goals. So then you have to slightly adjust the steps that we are taking now. So if you take a user-centered goal setting, you have your product vision, the user outcome, actions and actors to achieve. If you have a company-centered goal setting, then you have your product vision. But then in between, you also have to consider the company's objectives. And this you have to translate in outcomes for the user. And then you continue again, actions and actors. So if you don't start thinking about product vision, so you might want to consider why is the company considering developing this product? For example, you might want to expand its market or create a new market that he didn't have or develop more revenue. And maybe he is down on revenue, needs more, could be. Or maybe you want to use this product to demonstrate its capability and its expertise. And yeah, so think about it. Why the companies want to achieve this? Because yeah, you're working in this setting. So if you don't know this, and you're not helping the company achieve this thing, then it's very difficult to get the resources in your organization to achieve it. Yes. So first get your head around what the company's trying to achieve. So for example, it could be something very direct. So win 35% of the markets for exercise brands among 21 and 35 year old woman. So if the company wants that, now you have to think about, okay, how do I now translate this company goal set in a user outcome? Because as a user, I might find very interested the company wants it, but who cares? That doesn't really motivate me of buying your product. Yes. So you have to translate this. Okay. If the company wants this, they want this new show that they are capable and have expertise in this area. That's what they want. Okay. Then how could this expertise that is offered by the company be translated in something, an outcome the user might want? Yes. So maybe the user again wants to run the marathon. And by doing this, the company can show it's that it's the expertise and in this support, how people can run the marathon. Yes. So now you translated what the company wants into something, what the user wants, because that's our focus of our product, because we want to persuade the user to achieve this and help them. And users are less interested in what the company wants to achieve. So you have to make this bridge from this goal, a company goal to a user outcome. Once you have achieved that, you can continue with the same steps. Also important here is to identify your constraints. Yes. We all have constraints and that makes most of the time fun as a designer and engineer, because if you have no constraints, everything is possible. But constraints make you forced in coming something creative and come up with a solution that fits within the constraints. So maybe you can only allow to work in a certain channel. Yes. Your organization only develop mobile apps. So whatever it is, the solution should fit into a mobile app or a timeframe. You only have so much time to build a product. Now, I could imagine you are doing your project. You also have a limited deadline or you have a deadline, a limited time to achieve it. So find something that you develop something within this timeframe. Resources. I mean, it's really time is limited. Your money might be limited or the number of people that can work on it. So these are the constraints. Write them down. You need to know them. Also the tone. Maybe your company or organization want to always communicate in a certain way. So this tone might be constraining you also in the solutions that you have. So if your company wants to be perceived as very serious and like an expertise, you should not make a fun, application or something, because that doesn't match what the organization tried to achieve. Yes. So be aware of that. Also the target audience, the scope. Maybe it's not just all younger people, but a certain demographic. Maybe the ones on universities or specifically on a lower income setting. Yes. So figure the constraints that you have to work with within. Now, I said before, we're not allowed to think about the how. Now is the time to start thinking about the how. But don't think it's just one way of making people motivated to run the marathon or starting doing something that they can after five months to run the marathon. Think about multiple ways. So there are multiple ways that lead to Rome. And you want to know all those different ways and then pick the best one. Yeah. But to do this, you need first to come up with all the ways that leads you to Rome. In this case, all kinds of ideas. What action do people take that in five months they're capable of running the marathon? Yes. So defining who's doing the action is the physical action and thinking acting. And how does it then actually cause people to achieve this? Okay. So the example. So the outcome might be something people have less chance or 25% less chance to get a lung disease. That's the outcome. So how do I get there? That's the action. Stop buying cigarettes. Yes. So that is one. Because if you don't buy cigarettes, it's less likely that you smoke. And if you smoke less, less chance of lung diseases. So that's the action to the outcome. Okay. You engineers out there, still there. Don't think about the application that will help people with this how question. Yes. So don't formulate it in how the system would help people to wake up in the morning and start running and do this exercise every morning. Then they, at five months later, they can do the marathon. Yes. The computer is still out there. Don't look at it yet. First, try to figure out the behavior that the person has to change. What behavior do you want to create in a person to achieve this outcome? Yeah. So for the moment, forget about how the computer would help a person. That's a step later we'll look at. An example. So let's take our example from our university. It's imaginary example, of course. So this project could cost first year TU Delft students living in student houses in and around Delft to start their day at least four or five days a week with a healthy breakfast over their first half year in Delft. Okay. So I have the outcome there. So there's five healthy breakfasts. How do we achieve that after first half year? Okay. Now then we can be creative and come up. So I give you five ways already that we can do it. So first, buy healthy food and in the morning, eat the breakfast in his or her student home. That's one way. Second, to go to the local restaurant, a breakfast restaurant and eat a healthy breakfast. Another way of doing it, but you achieve that you eat five healthy breakfasts. Third, another way of achieving our outcome. Prefer five healthy breakfasts once a week and each morning eat one of these breakfasts. Another way, but you achieve your goal, your outcome. Fourth, having students go to bed on time so that they can prepare a get up to have enough time to eat a healthy breakfast. Yes. So maybe you conclude that it's the time that they in the morning don't have the time to eat a healthy breakfast or prepare it. So going early to bed, have enough time in the morning. So that might be the reason that you think you might end up with your outcome. And the last one, I was creative to come up with, have students set up a breakfast club with their group of students and each one member prepares a healthy breakfast for all group members for the whole week. Another strategy. So you could go on and on and on to make more and more. And I really encourage you to do this. Yes. Because the more you can think of, the more things you can play with and find the best option that you might be successful in achieving your target outcome. Yes. Now, how do you create this list? So Wendell give you a couple ideas. So think about what occurs just right before people do the exit that you want to eat breakfast. So you might observe they have to make the breakfast. So how do I make it easy to create or to have the breakfast? Okay. So now you can come up with some ideas. Another way of thinking is what is unique about the company? Maybe the company's facilitating something special that you can use. So if you are in a company who make breakfasts, okay, you could deliver in the morning these breakfasts. So maybe that's a strategy that people become a member of your customer list. And once they become a member, they always get a healthy breakfast in the morning. Also another way is to look what they are already doing and maybe something that you can expand. So maybe our students eating healthy in the weekend, but not during the week. So what is happening in the weekend that we can maybe translate into the week? Another thing of looking at is why, what is stopping people to doing this? So maybe they're stopping because they don't have healthy ingredients in the house. If they have, they should do it, could do it. All right, then, you know, all right, buying these healthy ingredients or getting these healthy ingredients, that's something that we have to target. Or why they are not motivated to do it. Maybe they like the taste, don't like the taste of it. So you have to help them to find food that is tasteful also and healthy. Another strategy Wendell suggests is to observe users in practice, to see what is happening. That could also inspire you. Yes, a long list of ways of helping you to come to this list. Now, once you have this list, now become interesting because now you can look at all those different ways to get to Rome, your outcome, and start picking the one which is the most, have the most likely to succeed in a sense. So what is Wendell suggesting? You look at the impact. So how effective is it in achieving it? The motivation, how likely motivated people would be to do this action, how easy it is for the user to do it, and the cost for the company. Yes, how easy or how many resources do you have to put in as a company to make that happen? And if you look at these five points, you could rate your each item on a high, middle, and low of these actions. Now here I've done it already. So we had those five ways of helping the TU Delft students to eat this five healthy breakfast in a week. And then I just rated them on impact, motivation, ease, cost for the company, give them numbers, and then bottom line, you add up the numbers. And see, here you see, for example, that action three has 11 points. So apparently three is something which is a winning action. So preparing five healthy breakfasts once a week, and each morning eat one of these breakfasts. So now I have an action or a kind of behavior that I want people to become accustomed to it. Because that I think will lead to the outcome. Yes. So also for your product, list a long list of these actions, do this evaluation. And based on this evaluation, pick the one that's the most, yes, get the most points. Yeah. And that is how you select a kind of the winning street. And then you can put it together in a kind of a sentence. This product will help activate people, track their exercises, and maintain their weight. Yes. Or more specific, you can now really start writing it down. This product will help 20 to 35 years old, active people in the urban areas, track their daily health exercise to build a muscle tone and lose five pounds more per year than the otherwise would. When successful, it would double our current revenue. Yes. So now you put all these things together. And now it becomes very concrete in who is have to do something, what they should do to, and what should be the outcome for the user, or maybe also for the company. Okay. Then it's also good to start thinking about what Wendell put forward is the minimal viable action. So what is the shortest, simple version of the target action that uses absolute mistake so that you can test whether the product idea is working. So Wendell suggests that you really have to figure out what is the minimal action and that you should observe that you know that your product is working. And it's important to know because later on you come up with ideas and you want to test it early on before you put lots of money and investment in it. So you want to clear your mind what is the behavior, the minimal behavior that you at least should observe, thinking that you're on the right track. Yes. And this means that you can look at all those actions and then cut things off. So for example, if you say, all right, they need to do five of these breakfasts. Let's, let's start. The minimal is that each, at least I see it once they do it, once a week, they prepare this healthy breakfast. Yes. So although the rest is just repeating that over five days, cutting it down to one now makes clear to me what is at least the minimal viable action that I want to observe. Maybe I can remove subtasks from it and cut clearly to the main task. Now try to do this, maybe going back to your list, for all these items that you really know, all right, this is the minimum. Maybe I've put on all kinds of extra things, but they're not that relevant. If they not do this, it's still fine. But this, if they don't do this, then I really complete consider my product a failure. Yes. So you should know what the minimal action is that you want to achieve. Okay. And then what Randall says, this puts together, creates a kind of a hypothesis about the behavior change. And yes, fill it a nice template, which you can fill in where by helping the, filling the actors, start or stopping, doing whatever will accomplish outcome. Yes. So by helping the first year TU Delft students start doing or start eating healthy breakfasts every morning, which prepared in the weekend, they will accomplish outcome, a habit of eating five times a week, healthy breakfasts. Yeah. Okay. I think this sums up what we done in the definition, defining your problem. Yes. So in Randall's book, chapter six, you see that we have developed a kind of a description where we want to go. We know our vision. We know the actor. We know the actions. We know the outcome. Now this is what you should have by the end of doing the product definition. Okay. So I hope you enjoyed it and we'll see you in the next video.
