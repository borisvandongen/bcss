Summary:

The lecture focused on the behavior change wheel, a method for developing behavior change interventions different from the model presented in the book by Wendel. Susan Michie's behavior change wheel includes three steps: understanding the behavior, identifying intervention options, and identifying content and implementation options. The central concept of the wheel is the COM-B model, which stands for Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation, leading to Behavior.

Key Components:

1. **Three Stages of the Behavior Change Wheel:**
   - Understanding the behavior
   - Identifying intervention options
   - Identifying content and implementation options

2. **COM-B Model (at the core of the Change Wheel):**
   - Capability: Split into psychological capability (mental ability) and physical capability (executing actions).
   - Opportunity: Split into social opportunity (influence of network/social context) and physical opportunity (environmental or situational factors).
   - Motivation: Split into reflective motivation (conscious decision-making) and automatic motivation (habits or emotional responses).
   
3. **Network Effect on Behavior:**
   - It's important to consider the influence of a person's social network on their behavior. For instance, targeting the behavior of others who buy or prepare food can be crucial for influencing a person's healthy eating habits.
   
4. **Levels of Intervention:**
   - Broader level: Considers legislative and fiscal changes or interventions.
   - Middle level: Looks at types of intervention like education, training, persuasion, and enabling.
   - Individual level: Focused on adjusting the individualâ€™s capability, opportunity, and motivation.

5. **Implementation Example:**
   - Michie's book provides a detailed example using nurses' hand hygiene, highlighting the assessment based on COM-B criteria to determine which areas require change and which do not.

In conclusion, the behavior change wheel is a structured approach that starts broadly and then narrows down to specific behaviors. The COM-B model at its center helps professionals identify what needs to change at the capability, opportunity, and motivation levels to alter behavior effectively. This model serves as a guide to pinpoint precise intervention strategies at individual, organizational, and national levels.

Behavior change wheel. In this video we will look at an other method for developing a behavior change intervention. So throughout the course we're using in the book of Wendel, but I also want to expose you to other authors. They have also come up with their method. And so you can understand a bit what the similarities are, also the different ideas people have. So in this video we're going to look at the behavior change wheel from Susan Mitzi. And after this video, I want you to understand the bit of the steps. She has the three steps, but also the COMB-B model, which is at the center of her wheel. Okay, so the three stages she recognized is the first stage, understanding the behavior. The second, identify the intervention option. And three, identify the content and implementation of the option. Yes, so you see there is a kind of going much more detailed and start very broad. In this video, I'll specifically look at the first stage and specific of selecting the target behavior and specify the target behavior and less on the other things. Because the first one, the problem in behavioral terms, we already looked at in Wendel, for example. Now let's start in selecting the target behavior. A good point that Mitzi made in her example is that you might have to consider the network, the social network a person is operating in. And you might have to target the behavior of others to achieve that the person that you really want to change happens. So quite abstract what I'm talking about. So if you want to eat healthy, you might depend on others that you actually start changing and eat more healthy. For example, you might not be the person who buys the food. So the person who buys the food is maybe a big factor in what you are eating. So the other person might buy the food and vegetables or high calorie food. So maybe we have to change the behavior of that person who buys the food to change your behavior in a sense to eat healthy food. Or this person might eat a lot at the company in the canteen. And if the canteen doesn't have healthy food, then you as the person would not eat healthy food. So Mitzi says so we might have to then to target the company that the catering that they start offering healthy food. Another person in a social network might be the person who makes the food. Maybe there's a couple and one makes the food and the other eats it or both eat them or they have shifts or something. But if the other is making the food, maybe their recipes are not very healthy and they make very rich food instead of this healthy thing. So maybe then we have to target this individual who makes the food. Another example Mitzi is giving about nurses, hand hygiene behavior. So if you go between patients that they wash their hands in between. Now who could you then target if you look at their social network? For example senior doctors, their behaviors. So the nurses might look at senior doctors if they also wash their hands, they might copy this behavior. That's a good strategy. Or admire that the patients are asking nurses, did you clean your hands? These kind of things. Or that the patients can see whether you did it or not. Now this can also motivate of course the nurses to do it. It could also be the domestic staff have to install gel dispensers so there is enough opportunity to clean your hands. And this together can all help the nurses to also show this hand cleaning hygienic behavior. Now at the core of Mitzi's wheel of change is this wheel. And this wheel shows there are different levels you can say you consider. So at the outer level you can say if you think about interventions about should you maybe start to change legislation as a whole company or a nation or maybe Europe on that level. There if you want to change air pollution or have much more healthy food or unhealthy food being removed from the shops that's that. But on this level you can also think about financial incentives. Say maybe by tax it could be more interesting to use solar panels or not. Yes now on that level you can also think when you think about these interventions. A bit the inner ring, the red ring you could say, you could think about general interventions. Is it a kind of a training? Is it an education? Are you enabling people? Persuading people? Yes or are you modeling that someone can see how others are doing? So there are general ideas how you create your intervention. But in the core you have the COMB-B model which we can see. Then you look at an individual. What is his or her capability? What is her and his or her opportunity to do it? And her or his motivation? So there you focus really on the individual. And the outer red ring is again the intervention that you could put around the individual. Now I was already talking about the COMB-B model. So what is the COMB-B model? COMB stands for capability, motivation, opportunity, behavior. Now if I read this the only first thing I'm thinking is a crime scene. So you are in court of law and what do you always have? Then you have a lawyer who says I will show that my suspect has or didn't have the capability of committing the murder. He has no motivation of committing the murder and he had no opportunity to commit the murder. Now basically that's the idea of COMB-B model. Yes so people should have the capability of doing the behavior, should be motivated to do the behavior and have the opportunity to show the behavior. If they're all aligned, then the chances are higher that people would actually do the behavior. And if you look at the capability, motivation, opportunity, you can split it up again. So the capability is either psychological capability. Do they have the the mental ability to do this? The physical, can they do the running or the jogging or cooking maybe? Motivation, is it reflective automation? Think about system one and two. Are they motivated because of system one? Have the routine, they do it always and it seems like tempting and there's kind of more emotional appeal that there. Or reflective, are they motivated to think about it? If they make a kind of cognitive long-term planning, does it make sense? And is that the part how you motivate them? An opportunity, social, is there a network allowing them to quit smoking or is the partner also smoking? That's quite difficult. And physically, is the opportunity there? Yes, are you in the middle of a meeting and that you're supposed to start doing running and exercises? That's not maybe a physical opportunity to do it. Yes, so you need to target the right moment when people have the opportunity to show this behavior. Now that's the B-model, which gives you an idea to consider if you try to offer these behaviors. If they have not enough capability, you should change something to improve their capabilities. Motivation, if that is lacking, you should do something to have enough motivation and opportunity. Maybe they should ask for a different time to suggest they do the behavior. Now let's go to a specific example that Mitchie gives in her book. And this is again back to the hygienic behavior of the hand cleaning by the nurses. Okay, so let's see. And what she does is interesting. She describes what is needed to occur and what is needed, but then if it's already need for a change, because maybe people are already doing it. So she indicates what is needed and then is there a change needed because this is not happening currently. So physical capability, have the physical capability of cleaning their hands. Now there's no need necessary there. The hospital staff are physically capable of cleaning their hands. So that's not the issue. Psychological capabilities, do they know the correct techniques? No change needed. They have a sufficient education about how to clean their hands. Do they know about if-then rules too, that they're right prompted when to use it? Now there's a problem. Yes, they might have a need to change there to motivate them each time. Oh yeah, if I go to the next bed, the next patient, it's a moment to clean my hands. So this if-then rules, that is something they have to work on. Now the physical opportunities. Are there enough alcohol gel dispensers available? Now apparently in this hospital, it's already there. So that's not the issue. Social opportunities. Do they see enough senior doctors cleaning their hands? Now maybe in this case, they don't see it enough. So how could we make that more visible that the senior doctors are also doing this? Reflective motivation. Do the nurses hold the belief that it is helpful to do this? No change needed. The nurses are convinced of this in this case. Are they convinced that they should do it consistently? And that they have really put effort into that, that they have to remember themselves that they have to do it. Now there's maybe some change needed, Mitchell indicates, because they think that they're already doing this. But maybe they really have to pay attention that they're actually really doing that. So here you recognize some change in the behavior is necessary. An automatic motivation. They have to establish a habit, a routine. There is no routine, she identifies that that is also something that needs to be changed. Now here it gives you, you see in this COM-B array, steps to indicate, all right, this needs to be changed. This doesn't, that's already fine. But it gives you a kind of a layer of precision to figure out what you actually need to do. Now that is really good of this behavior change wheel. Okay, now to summarize it again. So in the behavior change, we have three stages. Understanding the behavior like we did before. Try to figure out about the cleaning and the hygiene of the nurses. Then in the intervention opportunities. And then identify the content on how to implement it. And at the core of the wheel, we have different layers. At the core is the individual. A little bit outside the core is the kind of type of intervention you can do. And really on the larger scale is to really think about as an organizational or a national strategy to do the interventions. Okay, I hope you enjoyed it. See you in the next video.
