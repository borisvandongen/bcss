### Summary of Lecture on Learning

**Definitions:**
- **Learning:** The process through which experiences cause permanent changes in knowledge or behavior.

**Psychoanalysis:**
- Initiated by Freud, it emphasizes the role of the subconscious mind and introspection.
- Heavily criticized but has had significant influence.
- It focuses on internal processes and symbolism.

**Behaviorism:**
- Popular in the US and uses animal testing to focus on objective, observable behavior.
- It views the brain as a "black box" and ignores internal thoughts, emphasizing the stimulus-response relationship.

**Cognitivism:**
- Arises out of criticism of behaviorism, advocating the study of internal processes.
- Influenced by the development of computers, it emphasizes concepts like attention, beliefs, goals, and language.
- Focuses on how information is stored in and retrieved from memory.

**Constructivism:**
- Suggests that individuals construct their own knowledge and reality through experiences and interactions.
- Emphasizes active learning, as opposed to the idea of the mind as an empty vessel to be filled with knowledge.

**Implications for Behavior Change:**
- Understanding these different approaches to learning can inform the design of behavior change support systems.
- Each school of thought offers insights into how to facilitate new behavior learning:
  - Behaviorism: Through modifying environmental cues and responses.
  - Cognitivism: By understanding and targeting cognitive processes.
  - Constructivism: By enabling experiential learning and personal interpretation.

**Summary:**
- Awareness of these psychological schools of thought can guide the development of applications and systems to support learning and behavior change.
- Behaviorism links the environment directly to behavior.
- Cognitivism connects environmental perception to cognitive processing, which then leads to behavior.
- Constructivism focuses on how personal interpretation of perception influences behavior.

**Conclusion:**
- The lecture highlighted the importance of understanding different learning theories to effectively develop support systems for behavior change. The goal is to utilize the most suitable learning principles depending on the context and the desired outcomes.

## Transcript

Learning. Welcome to the lecture on learning. In this video I give you a short introduction to learning. If you look at learning, it's in a sense heavily connected to psychology and also the history in psychology. Because there are different schools of thoughts and movements within psychology. And here you can see that learning is really perceived differently. What is actually happening in a human when they learn. So let's start with the psychoanalyst. Yes, so that was a movement that started after Wundt started his experimental psychology lab in Germany. And later on you get Freud as a very dominant movement he started in Europe. And what happens in that time is they use often introspection. Introspection means someone lies on the couch and think about his thinking process. And Freud often stressed the importance of the subconscious what he mentioned there. So you might not be aware but this whole world of symbolism is going on around. Which influence why you do certain things. Heavily criticized all the ideas of what the Freud's had put forward. But important here it is an important movement. And still reaching out and have impact in today's research. But this is one tradition. We won't look that much into it. But I just want to mention that it exists. Because then you understand also the reaction to the next step. So here with introspective the criticism here was of course it's very subjective. How do we know that you actually are aware about the thinking process? And so as another movement you saw behaviorism. This is a tradition you see also more in the US. And here they often use instead of humans animal testings. Because they want to be a kind of science. And science should be objective and not this introspective stuff. The other guys were doing you would say. So they want to see the outside world. They were not that interesting in what people were thinking. Because they thought that was not really relevant. To understand that isn't from a scientific purposes. So they only did observable kind of research. They saw if you put up this sign what happened to that person. So you change something in the environment and then see the response. The organism if they call that. The human or the animal were doing that. So they treated basically the brain the thinking process as a black box. Don't try to look in it. Which you saw with the psychoanalyst. They tried to understand started from the inside. What were people thinking directly. Now the criticism against on behaviorism was it was very restrictive and limited. You're not allowed to see what's in the black box. But we know something is happening in your head. So why not study this. So there you understand the next tradition is cognitivism. Which says yes we should study what is happening there. And so how are people thinking? What is going on now? This movement you see also connected with the rise of computers. Because they took it off as a metaphor. And thinking about for example this symbolic processing. Which we see in artificial intelligence. That they also took for a view on how people might be thinking. Here now important become concepts like attentions, beliefs, goals, language. All these things were more or less ignored in behaviorism. And what's often been studied there initially were memory. Because that is an important part. If you want to learn something in a cognitive perspective. How does it end up in your memory? And how do you get it out of your memory? To do the things you need to do. Then you also have Pidgett. The Frenchman which looks more at instead of looking at an individual. Because cognitive is still how does an individual learn? How do we put information in this person? This kind of perspective is more constructivism. How does a person create his own reality? Because this movement says look it's rather subjective how things are perceived. So there might not be really one truth out there. People have to construct their own knowledge. To see and by talking to people, to experience with people. These things then develop their own knowledge. If you see it from that perspective. It's really different than the cognitive. Which sometimes seen as like the empty vessel. We have to pour in knowledge. Where in constructivism the user is active. And start talking to people. Experience things. And by that they start establish insights and knowledge. So if you look at those different traditions. You see different times paths. And there were some quite old already. Like the psychoanalyst. But more or less died out. Behaviorism had his upturn. But less research. Cognitivism is quite popular still. Constructivism you see lots of things in learning going on there. In this video we will look at behaviorism, cognitive and constructivism. And we'll explain the different principles. They have about learning. And which you might also use in your behavior change support system. Because in this lecture we will look at learning. Because a lot of behavior change is connecting with learning. How do I learn a new behavior? How do I establish this thing? By looking at learning, the psychology behind that. We might also understand how our support system. Might be used to facilitating this learning. So that's the reason why we're going to look at it in this video lecture. And I will jump to the different kinds of schools about learning. Psychological schools, schools of thought. And help you there and here. About what you could do for your application. To support this kind of learning. I hope you enjoy it. And if you might get confused. Think about it a bit differently. If you think about behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism. Is how do they in a sense connect something in the world. What people perceive and how they connect it to behavior. Behaviorism try to make a connect link. Something in the environment and there's behavior. Yes, there's no understanding what happens inside the person. Cognitivism focus on the processing. There is something happening is being perceived in the environment. There is the processing. Something happening in the brain. And there's the behavior. Constructivism you also have perception. But it's very important the interpretation. How do I interpret what I'm observing? That leads to the behavior. So that helps you a bit at looking at these different videos. I hope you enjoy it.
