Summary of Cognitive Perspective in Learning:

**Cognitivism:**
Cognitivism focuses on examining internal mental processes to understand how people think, remember, and learn. Unlike behaviorism, which treats the mind as a black box and focuses on observable behavior, cognitivism opens the 'black box' and looks into the intricate processes that take place in the mind.

Key Concepts:
1. **Schema Theory**: Knowledge is organized into units called schemas, which influence how information is interpreted, stored, and recalled. Remembering is an active process of reconstruction, not just a passive retrieval of information.

2. **Memory:** It involves encoding, storing, and retrieving information. To improve memory:
   - Make information meaningful.
   - Establish retrieval structures (mnemonics, for example).
   - Practice recalling information to increase retrieval speed.

3. **Motivation:** Intrinsic motivators, such as challenge and curiosity, play a role in learning. Techniques for enhancing intrinsic motivation in educational settings can include gamification, attention focusing, meaningful engagement, giving control, challenging learners, arousing curiosity, and providing encouragement.

Learning Processes According to Schema Theory:
- **Assimilation:** Adding new information into an existing schema.
- **Tuning:** Modifying schemas in light of new information.
- **Restructuring:** Forming new schemas or significantly revising existing schemas.

**Memory Considerations:**
- **Encoding:** The process of transforming sensory input into a form that can be stored in memory.
- **Storage:** The process of maintaining information in memory over time.
- **Retrieval:** The process of recalling information stored in memory when needed.

**Cognitive Therapy:** A form of therapy that seeks to change irrational beliefs or thoughts by:
- Monitoring and identifying automatic thoughts.
- Challenging these thoughts and core beliefs.
- Encouraging patients to question and revise distorted cognitions.

Examples of Cognitive Distortions:
- Catastrophizing
- Emotional Reasoning
- Polarization
- Selective Abstraction
- Mind Reading
- Labeling
- Minimization and Maximization
- Imperatives

**Intrinsic Motivation Factors (Malone & Lepper):**
- Challenge
- Curiosity
- Control
- Fantasy

**Keller's ARCS Model of Motivational Design:**
- Attention
- Relevance
- Confidence
- Satisfaction

**Conclusion:**
The cognitive perspective emphasizes the importance of the internal processes of learning and memory and the role that schemas play in how we perceive and interact with the world. It illustrates the need to make learning meaningful and attentive to enhance memory and motivation, thereby facilitating deeper understanding and application.

Cognitive perspective. In this video, we will be looking at the cognitive based learning principles. We're going to look at schema theory, look a bit about memory and also finish with motivation. So summarize Cognitivism. It specified the process and the structure underlying the cognitive performance, where behaviorism, we're thinking about the black box, about what was going on between the ears, you could say. Cognitivism, we look inside the box. We try to understand the process and the structure, how people remember and perform sort of cognitive tasks. The assumption is that information from the environment is processed in a series of modules, you could say, and then transform in a certain way and that leads to behavior. So learning is a discrete change in states in knowledge. So we start assembling knowledge and based on this knowledge, we be able to perform in certain way. So to understand that learning, we must study how people perceive, organize and alter and store information. So it's a process that we're looking at and often how we started this is with memory experiments or how people learn certain things in Cognitivism. Okay, so the principles here is a bit of an, they were not satisfied with behaviorism. I mentioned it already because we could not explain everything with behaviorism, large parts where you really have to understand the cognitive process and also the arrival of the computer as a metaphor of looking at how people process information. And therefore we also start considering things like a memory, which you also have in a computer, attention, but motivation, which you don't see in a computer. So if you look at the information process model in Cognitivism, you actually see lots of things that you would normally also see in a computer. So we have sensory processing, perception and working memory and long time memory, selecting of a process of actions and execute something. And there's a feedback loop. And on top of it, there's attention, resources limited now. So here you can see that people at the time start really considering, all right, how could we also look at the human from this perspective? And here, a lot of studying was then also then being focused on memory and recognition. Also where research going on perception, but I kind of focus for learning now on the memory part. And the memory part is the structure of what's going on there. So schema therapy theory is a description of how knowledge or information is packed and stored in long-term memory. So remembering thing is also not a kind of a fixed process as you actually remember everything as it is. Like you have an implant from the environment and it's stored into your memory. No, it's an active process. It's some imaginative reconstruction fitting into other packages. And later, if we recall it, we have to access this thing. And also using these schemas, these kind of things help us also to reconstruct what we think we remember. So it's an active activity. And to understand this, I'm going to read to you. The War of the Coasts. One night, two young men from Illak went down to the river to hunt seals. And while they were there, it became foggy and calm. They then heard war cries and they thought, maybe this is a war party. They escaped to the shore and hide behind a log. Now canoes came up and they heard the voices of paddles and they saw one canoe coming up to them. There were five men in the canoe and they said, what do you think? We wish to take you along. We are going up the river to make war on the people. One of the young men said, I have no arrows. Arrows are in the canoe, they said. I will not go along. I might be killed. My relatives do not know where I have gone, but you, he said, turning to the others, might go with them. So one of the young men went, but the other returned home. And the warriors went up the river to a town on the other side of Kalakama. The people came down to the water and they began to fight and many were killed, but presently the young men heard one of the warriors say, quick, let's go home. That Indian had been hit. Now he thought, oh, they are ghosts. He did not feel sick, but they said he has been shot. So the canoe went back to Alak and the young man went ashore to his house and made a fire. And he told everyone and said, behold, I accompanied the ghost and we went to fight. Many of our fellows were killed and many of those who attacked us were killed. They said I was hit and I did not feel sick. He told it all and then he became quiet. When the sun rose, he fell down. Something black came out of his mouth. He became quiet. His face became contorted. The people jumped up and cried he was dead. So we just listened to this story, which is a story of Indians in the west coast of Canada. So Barlet gave it to people just before the First World War in the UK. Of course, this story was completely not what they used to hear a story and it was really from a different culture. So he was just observing how they would remember the story because he gave it to them and asked them in different times to repeat and tell to them, write it down what they can remember of the story. Now, what he observed was that people could really poorly remember the whole story together because the culture was so different and they fit it into their way of their life and also how they think about storylines. So they admit stuff from the story, change things and also the order was changed. So for example, when there's something black came out of his mouth was changed into he was for example vomiting and hunting seals became where they were fishing and a canoe they might not have seen that was just a boat and the role of the ghost, which is a very typical story here for the Indians was completely changed in the order for these English people. So the point that Barlet tried to make here is we not just simply remember things if they how they were, but they are changed and stored in a memory depending how the kind of schemas, the kind of knowledge representation that we have, which means that it's an active process remembering. So if we learn, it's also not that we just tell them and we just observe and hear and remember things. The learner in a sense is active in this way in how he takes information from this. Now I'm just make a very long story, but just make it easier. So when I was young, so much days before today, for the first time I was using a computer, I was looking at it as a typewriter. So before I hadn't used a computer, I only had to use a typewriter. And for those familiar with the typewriters, it's basically of hammers typing on a paper and you move around and scroll and a piece of paper where you position your characters. And return means you move the paper up or down, yes? So the character and the space, space bar, then you move left or right. So they are not actually characters. So when I use the computer in the first time, I start using that idea also to computers. So if I looked, I've looked at my notes from the past, there I wrote down, oh, with the space, the cursor goes that way. And to return, the cursor goes that way. So I was again trying to position the hammer of my typewriting. But for a computer, a return and a space are characters, yes? So here you see that I try to learn and understand the situation from a schema, which I have from the past. Now, this is important if you try to teach someone something new, he might look at it from the schemas they already have. And then I might not understand the situation and take different learning elements from it. Yeah. And that is also how people then think back of it, what happens. So again, so what you observe is not just directly put in your long time memory. You have this kind of fit into the schema, how people might remember things. Now, if you look at schema theory, there are three ways that learning occurs. So you have assertion, that means they have a new example that fits into an existing schema. So it's another instantiation, you could say, which fits. Then you have tuning. So there's new information coming in, which doesn't completely fit in the schema, but the schema is slightly adapted. And then you have restructuring. Because new schemas are created, something new a person haven't learned before, but often it's linked or referred to on an other schema. So on a re-existing already. As the example I gave for the typing machine and then moving to the computer. So if you look at memory, it's therefore important also to understand how people, in a sense, how the memory performs. So there are a couple of, three things which you have to consider. Is the meaningful of the coding. So the things I'm telling you, if I find that put meaning to it, I might remember it better. So in the story of the War of the Coast, a lot of things were forgotten by people because they didn't pay much attention. They find it not that relevant. Yes. So the order of the coast, these things. So if you want to make sure people understand something, you have to make it meaningful to them. That helps them to remember things. Yes. So one way of doing it, for example, is if you have a series of numbers, it might be very confusing. But if you say, look, this is a date or this is a number associated with the table of three or something. Yes. Then people see a pattern and start to see meaning into unrelated things. So giving this meaning helps people to remember things. Now this is for the coding. Also you have to get it out of the memory. So it helps sometimes to also connect some retrieval structure with it. That sounds complicated, but it means you often do this. So if you remember in the past, when you have to remember a couple of words for different language, then you often might have a monomic. So the A stands for apple. The B stands for banana. Yes. And then you remember a certain word. And if you have this certain word, you could remember the other topics. Yes. So in this way, you create a retrieval structure. Now the retrieval structure can also be a storyline or a kind of a metaphor. But as soon as you connect to this, you're capable of accessing the other parts of your memory. Now accessing more often increases speed that you can remember things. So training people to recognize and to recall these things help in remembering it. Now I mentioned already a couple of types of therapy. So I also want to talk about cognitive therapy. Because lots of behavior change might also have to do with changing people's mental thinking process. Now in therapy, one way of doing is cognitive therapy. And I just want to explain a little bit because it might be interesting also for the cases that you're working in. So what happens often in cognitive therapy is that they want to change irrational beliefs or thoughts people might be having and trying to restructure these ideas. The idea is the way you think also makes you the way you feel. And that's so it's something and what they call is the ABC model. So you have an activity in the environment, something's happening to you. But this triggers beliefs in you, which might be automatic thoughts. So you see someone passing by and he's not looking at you, then you might get the automatic thought. Oh, I'm invisible for this person. He doesn't like me. And that triggers a consequence as to see as an emotion. You might feel bad because look, they think I'm worthless scum or something they just can ignore. Yes. So these are the automatic reactions. And interesting to see that so the activity around you is not an objective thing. Yes. It's because I believe I have a certain schema activated that makes me feel in a certain way. Now, so you have those automatic thoughts and which are the friends of people might not actually be always aware of them. So you really have to work and write it down to see, oh, yeah, that's happening. And they often connected to rooted in, you could say, deep dysfunctional ideas people might have. So the really underlying schemas about the ideas they might have about themselves. Now, and that you try to work on. But understanding the distortion might people already have this kind of way of thinking might be interesting to look at. So here is a number of eight of distortive. And we quickly let's go through them. And sometimes help you to think, all right, this is what people might be happening with thinking. So catastrophizing. So people might always think about the worst might be happening to all this not gonna happen always. Yes. So losing my job will end my career, but you might find another job and continue your career. Yes. Reasoning is another kind of distorted of cognition. So the feeling that I feel desperate means that the situation is desperate. That doesn't have to be the situation doesn't have to be desperate. So reasoning because you feel certain way doesn't mean it is that always that way. Polarization. Yes. So it's only one or the other. So I should always get the highest score. Otherwise I'm a loser. Yeah. You can also not get the highest score and not be a loser, but yeah, all right. Selective abstraction. Yes. So a situation, but you select only to put your attention to certain things. So you only look at the people around you that hate you and ignore all the people that love you. Yes. That's also not very healthy. Mental reading. That's another kind of cognitive disorder. Some people try to think that they can assume without evidence to understand what the other person is thinking, which is quite hard. Yes. Labeling. Putting labels on all kinds of things like right or wrong or about yourself. I'm incompetent. I'm bad. I'm yes. So that's also not healthy to minimize and maximization. So if something is good for you, then you minimize it. So in a sense, like I got a nine, but everyone got a nine. Yes. Or I did the marathon, but everyone could run the marathon. Yes. It's also not healthy. And then the last one, eight imperatives means that I should be perfect in everything I do. Yes. So it's interpreting the terms I think should have been rather than how they actually are. So I should have been more polite. I should have been nicer. I should perform better. Oh, it's quite difficult if you think like that. So all right. So these are kind of things you might want to change in this cognitive therapy. Now, how is cognitive therapy then working? It tries to first monitoring and identify those automatic thoughts people might be having. And try to recognize, also learn people this ABC, that you have something in the environment that triggers some belief that then affects some emotion associated with it. Then the therapy often start to challenge those automatic thoughts and core beliefs. Are you a bad person? Is no one really liking you now? Maybe they do some experimentation, ask people, do you like me? Is everyone? And see to challenge those, and maybe people then change the way they view themselves. And then I mentioned already, change their beliefs. That was point five. Okay. We've been talking a lot about therapy, but also if you look at cognitive therapy, a theory and a cognitivism is motivation because we're now also interested in what motivates people, a person. So Malunek and Lapper, for example, have looked at intrinsic motivators. So it is interesting if you develop, for example, a game or an environment that have to motivate people. So challenging people can motivate people. Curiosity. If something, what's happening there or control that they control what's happening. That's also motivate. If you only have to follow whatever that system is throwing at you, it's not much fun, but if you can make decisions, that makes it interesting. Fantasy. That's also helping in games to motivate people. Keller also has some ideas. Attention is important. Put attention there. Relevance helps to motivate. Confidence building and satisfaction. Okay. Techniques to enhance intrinsic motivation, therefore, if you think about gaming. So that might be helpful. Gaming techniques to motivate people. In one of the lectures, we're going to talk about gamification, therefore. Also again, what we talked about is attention that you have to draw to people that helps them to motivate and also make a better encoding. So use a kinds of extra elements in your computer environment to draw attention. Yes. Learn people into and try to learn and to that they have to pay attention to your environment, to your computer application. And again, block out the other distraction that you may have. So this encourage, this extra make it nice, make it fun, this kind of encourage deep learning of the cognitions. Make it also an explorative environment. Yes. Curiosity and fantasy we mentioned already. And give the learner control. Allow them to do things. And we've seen that already when we talked about the self-determination theory, where we talked about the importance of control. Challenge the learner. Yes. Because people like to be a bit challenged and that makes it more exciting. And arouse the curiosity. And give them encouragement. And even when they make errors, if they do something wrong, say, all right, that's fine. That's common. You tried. You made an attempt. That's already good. Yeah. So put all these kind of techniques to motivate people in. Okay. Now let's summarize. Cognitivism. So we talked about schema theory. Yes. So kind of structures and the process people process information and store it and retrieve it. Therefore, we talked about memory, how we do the encoding, retrieval, that is important. And also motivation, which also influence the way people process information. Okay. So that was it for this video. And I hope you enjoyed it. And I see you in the next video.
