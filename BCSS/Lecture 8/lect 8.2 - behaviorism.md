Summary:

Behaviorism is an approach in psychology that focuses on observable behaviors and seeks to predict and control them. It emphasizes learning as an association between stimuli in the environment and an individual's behavioral response.

The three main principles of behaviorism discussed in the lecture are:

1. **Habituation**: This refers to the process by which individuals learn to ignore a repeated stimulus over time. An example provided was getting used to the sound and sight of a tram and no longer reacting to it as a potential threat.

2. **Classical Conditioning**: Developed by Ivan Pavlov, it involves pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus that elicits an unconditioned response. After repeated associations, the neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus and elicits a conditioned response – as with Pavlov's dogs salivating to the sound of a bell after it was previously paired with the presentation of food.

3. **Operant Conditioning**: This principle emphasizes the consequences of behavior. It was divided into four types:
   - Positive reinforcement: Adding a desirable stimulus to increase a behavior.
   - Negative reinforcement: Removing an aversive stimulus to increase a behavior.
   - Positive punishment: Adding an aversive stimulus to decrease a behavior.
   - Negative punishment: Removing a desirable stimulus to decrease a behavior.
   
   Extinction refers to the diminishing of a conditioned response when reinforcements are no longer provided. 

The pattern of reinforcement can be fixed (consistent response) or variable (intermittent response), with variable reinforcement often leading to more persistent behavior.

In addition to these principles, the professor touched upon the different types of rewards in the Hook model – the reward of the tribe (social reinforcement), the reward of the hunt (satisfaction from the activity itself), and the reward of the self (intrinsic motivation).

Finally, the lecture noted Skinner's suggestions for effective learning programs: presenting material in small steps, checking for understanding, providing immediate feedback, and acknowledging that learning is often a linear or branching process.

The main takeaway from behaviorism is the focus on the environment's impact on behavior and the use of association and consequences to modify and understand behaviors.

Behaviorism. In this video I will explain behaviorism and focus specific on learning. And after this video you should be able to describe three behaviorism learning principles, habituation, classical conditioning and operant conditioning. Behaviorism, again, is trying to focus on people's behavior objectively. So it wants to see the outside world and things they can observe on a person to see what's happening. So that's what they're studying. So they want to control and predict people's behavior and in the manner that they want to do it is a kind of in a like natural science. Yes. As we talked about before, before you had these other kinds of schools of thought in psychology with introspection where you could not observe what people were thinking. Behaviorism is all about seeing what is happening and only focus on these phenomenons. But the key is there is if you look at behaviorism is that we observe what happens in the environment and then see what happens to a person. So learning is basically an experience that you have because you experience something in the environment. So that's the focus here of behaviorism. So if we nail it down. So the goal is to predict or control behavior. The assumptions are that people react based on response to a certain stimuli in the environment. And learning is basically established by association. Yes. So you associate something in the environment with some certain behavior. And to change behavior, therefore, is a relevant learning experience is must be provided. Let's look at some of those principles. Habituation. So habituation is a single event that you learn to, in a sense, ignore it. That's the learning. Yes. And for example, take an example, if you take the tram in the street, it's a big huge thing and you might at first think like, oh, what to do? Is it dangerous or not? But you see it's nothing is happening. So you start in a sense ignoring it. And that's the habituation sets in. Flying is another one. You see a metal thing going up in the air. It's not falling out of the air. You step in, you fly with it. It all seems to work. You get used to it. Yes. So habituation. So that's an important learning principle. Classical conditioning, Pavlov, often associated with this. So you have an event and another event and that you connect with learning. Yes. So in Pavlov's case, he learned or observed his dog drooling that he could connect or associate with the tingling his bell, yes, ringing his bell. So what we have there is first you have a situation where you have meat and there is the drooling response. So the meat is the unconditioned stimuli and the drooling of the dog is the unconditioned response. Unconditioned because we didn't try to condition them. So that's the natural existing one. Now we add, when the meat is shown, also the bell. Yes, that's a neutral stimuli because it's neutral because before it was not associated with the drooling. So it's neutral in that sense. Then we do this a couple of times, showing the bell, showing the meat, ringing the bell and then we observe the drooling. And then on the later stage, we remove the food and we only ring the bell and we see the dog still drooling. So now it's a conditioned stimulus, yes, where it was neutral, didn't react to this response. Now we have conditioned the dog on the bell to start drooling. That is classical conditioning. Moving on, operant conditioning. We've seen that already when we talked about the hook model with when a person did something rewarded. Yes. So here there is a behavior and we do something afterward. Classical conditioning is the other way around. We do something before it and then we have the behavior, the drooling of the dog. So with operant conditioning, we try to see the behavior that we want and then we do something. Now there are different ways of operant conditioning. So let's start with positive reinforcement. Here you present something positive afterwards. Yes. So you give him a treat if you do something nice. Negative reinforcement. You remove something. All right. If you do this thing I want, you don't have to eat this nasty thing which you don't like. Yes. So you remove something what they normally have to do. Then positive punishment means you do something which I don't want you to do. And there there's a negative consequence. So if you do this, I take in your weekly allowance. Yes. All right. Now I will not do it because I would lose a lot of money. My weekly allowance, for example. Yes. So this decrease the probability of a behavior where the other was to increase it and the positive reinforcement or the negative reinforcement. Then we also have the negative punishment. And then we remove something what is favorable. So we normally had a nice dessert. But if you do this thing, I take away your nice dessert. Yes. Again, it decreases the chance that you will do the behavior. Then we have extinction. That's the last one. Is a natural response that occur after not giving any more the previous reinforcement. Yes. So you have always get the sweetie if you do it. Now we stop giving the sweetie. And now you start stopping also this behavior, extinction. Now let's look about the pattern of reinforcing that can also be there. So we could have a fixed, always you do something, there's always a response. Or you could say sometimes we do something and sometimes we reward you. But in some cases we don't reward you. So there's the fixed response or the variable response. Now the fixed response, what happens is you see a much earlier that people start showing this behavior. Yes. So higher chance that people start showing this behavior. However, if you stop giving this response, you see also a rapid return and extinction happening. With this variable response, you initially see don't see a steep uptake. But when you stop, you see that the behavior gets going on longer. The variable response is a bit slightly different than we talked about the Hooke model. Yes. Because that was always a slightly different type of response. Here it's about the timing of the response, whether you always or not give a response. Okay. In the Hooke model, there are also different types of rewards, which I also didn't explain, but I think it's good to talk about. So we have the reward of the tribe, the reward of the hunt and the reward of the self. They talk about. So the tribe is a reward that is a social reward. There's a social reinforcement. You get a reward feeling accepted or important. Now, if you look at Twitter or something, you get other people retweeting your stuff or pin your thing that you do something. And Facebook, you get likes, these kind of things. And on Stack Overflow, for example, people could, when you submit your answer, could say, all right, that's a good response or up or down. Yes. And at the end, I think you get even a badge. Yes. And then there are rewards you get of the tribe and your surrounding. Now, the rewards of the hunt, there's the idea that there's rewards you get for doing the activity. So you search and you find something. So that could be on the internet or YouTube. So the reward itself is doing the thing. So gambling, you get the rewards of the money you get. Then there are also the rewards of the self, which are important. Yes. So you're funneling into the intrinsic motivation. So you are capable of doing it. You feel good about yourself and you must have something, you complete something, which is important. So you are capable of solving the puzzle, advancing the game. And so you feel also good about this kind of things. Now, that's also important to consider as a reward. Now, if you look at learning, Skinner, the guy with doing all the things with the rats and this kind of thing, also came up with the idea for a learning program. So if you're learning, he says, look, present the material in very small steps. Yes. Break it up. Ask people about questions about these things and ensure that they understood it. And then if they do this kind of things, they're studying and they do it in the right way. Give them an immediate feedback. Yes. Say, all right, well done, or this is wrong. But immediate feedback, because in the stimulus response is operant conditioning. You have a behavior and that needs some response to it. So therefore, the feedback is important according to him. And then it's most time learning is a kind of a linear process. It might be a branch of different things, but going from one to the other. Let's summarize this. So in behaviorism, we looked at habituation. Yes. So you in a sense, learn to ignore some stimuli. Then we had a classening conditioning where we have this connection with the unconditioned behavior and then we add a neutral kind of stimuli and later it becomes conditioned on that stimuli. Remember the dog of Pavlov with the bell. And then we have operant conditioning where we see a behavior and there is some response. And based on the response, you get an increase the people who do this behavior, like you give them some reward or a decrease, because maybe you give them some punishment or take something away which they desire. Okay. I hope you enjoy it and I'll see you in the next video.
