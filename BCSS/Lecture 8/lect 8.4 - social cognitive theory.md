Summary of Social Cognitive Theory Lecture:

**Social Cognitive Theory (SCT):**
- Central concept: learning from observed behavior (in contrast to Behaviorism, which emphasizes personal experience and associations).
- SCT suggests individuals can learn by observing others.
- Key elements involve self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and social support structures.

**Self-Efficacy:**
- Defined as one's belief in their own ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task.
- High self-efficacy can lead to setting challenging goals and a commitment to achieving them.
- Self-efficacy influences outcome expectancies (i.e., the anticipated consequences of behavior).
- Self-efficacy can be enhanced by various factors including mastery experience, social modeling, physical and emotional states, and verbal persuasion.

**Ways to Influence Self-Efficacy:**
1. **Mastery Experience:** Confidence grows from past successful experiences.
2. **Social Modeling:** Learning by observing peers who have successfully performed a behavior.
3. **Improving Physical and Emotional States:** Being physically and emotionally well contributes to higher self-efficacy.
4. **Verbal Persuasion:** Being encouraged by others can enhance self-efficacy.

**Bobo Doll Experiment:**
- Demonstrated that children imitate aggressive behavior observed in adults, highlighting the impact of social modeling.

**Self-Regulation:**
- Individuals can apply strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, self-reward, self-instruction, and social support to regulate their behaviors and enhance learning.

**Conclusion:**
- Improving self-efficacy is crucial for behavior change.
- Scholastic strategies can help individuals regulate their behavior and achieve their goals.
- SCT emphasizes the importance of social factors in learning and behavior change, offering a broader perspective than Behaviorism.

Social Cognitive Theory. In this video I'm going to talk about Social Cognitive Theory and put it in the context of learning. So after this video you should have an idea how you could use Social Cognitive Theory to have people learn stuff. And learn, yes. So let's look at it. Because this picture is already interesting. You see an adult and a baby and you can see she's eating some healthy food and the baby starts maybe copying this idea. So copying behavior of learning from observed behavior is a key principle in the Social Cognitive Theory. And that's interesting because if you look at behaviorism this thing doesn't exist, yes. The idea was that you had to create an association or have an experience yourself. But Social Cognitive Theory is about you can just see what others are doing and start learning from that as well. And that is one important element of Social Cognitive Theory. Here is a schematic sketch of the theory. So here you have again self-efficacy, input effect goals and behavior. Now in goal setting theory you have already seen how goals are important to determine performance. But here in Social Cognitive Theory we have a factor before that, self-efficacy. And self-efficacy, this ability or your not your ability but your confidence that you are able to do a certain task determines whether you would do a certain task and also influence the outcomes expectancy and influence also your goals in the social structures that are there to support you to achieve the goal. So let's look at it a bit more in detail. So the perceived self-efficacy is this ability that you are able to bring about this outcome that you set yourself. The example here could be for example improving people's belief or women's belief about the ability to convince a partner of using a condom. So if you don't feel that you are capable of persuading your partner of doing that it's less likely that you will actually try to do this, to start this discussion. So improving people's self-efficacy increases the chance that you would set yourself this goal of having discussion about condoms. Now the outcome expectancy is you can change also people's expectation, the value or the consequence of the behavior. So if people think that sex with a condom is not fun anymore then if you change that belief and the expectation then people are also more likely to show this kind of behavior. Now the social construct, the facilitators that could also be in the environment or the social environment could support or facilitate this kind of behaviors or make it less or less unless likely. So for example if there are more distribution of condoms again it facilitates the use of condoms. But in this video I want to talk specifically focus on self-efficacy how we could improve and help that. And Ben Dura, who is the key person behind the social cognitive theory has five ways of influencing self-efficacy. Mastery of experience, social modeling, improving physical and emotional state and verbal persuasion. Now let's start with mastery of experience. So one element or base for the determination of self-efficacy is your past experience. So if you were in the past capable of doing something and you have to do it again then you're more comfortable of doing it because you know from the past that you were capable of doing it. So that's mastery experience. So for example if you have to drive a bike and you know you've done it so many times before then you're quite comfortable of doing that. So this mastery experience is really important. And now the trick is always how to give people this mastery experience. Because that's the chicken and egg problem that we talked before. To obtain the mastery experience you need already a bit of confidence to do it or willing to expose yourself to try it. Now in some cases that might be very difficult. Now one way we tried in our research to tackle this is for example to allow people to try something in virtual reality. So if you are a bit nervous about giving a talk in public try to give it in virtual reality to a virtual audience. So maybe you feel already a bit that you have a mastery experience. Although we did it in virtual reality you might have still the experience and then you might improve your self-efficacy by this and then you might do it in reality as well. Let's move to social modeling. So social modeling and we talked already about it is you learn also from viscarious experience. An experience when you witness someone else doing it. And here it's important of course the closeness to the model. So if you think all right for example that's my colleague he's more or less the same capability as me. If he or she can do it I can also do it. Now that's important. If you for example say all right I want to run the marathon and I see there the Dutch champion in running you think yeah forget it that person is way better than me. So then the link is too far of the model. Now why is this working? And important here is the Bobo the doll experiment. And that is one experiment Bandura did that opened people's eyes in a sense that there's more than just behaviorism or information processing but there's also this social element. Now let's look into Bobo the doll experiment. So this is an experiment he did with children who are exposed to behavior of an adult. So he broke up a group of children too and so have two conditions. So one group of children so they started all first observing so they were sitting and seeing an adult also playing. Now in one condition the adult was playing just as civilized with also kind of thought and there was a big Bobo the doll somewhere in the background. The one the polite condition you could say that the adult ignored the doll. In the other condition the aggressive condition the adult started really being quite aggressive to the doll. Sitting on it, kicking it, also verbally abusing. Kill, kill and these kind of things. Now in the next phase in both groups the children went to another room where they can play for two minutes with some very nice toys. And after that they were taken away to the next room. So it in a sense created a bit of frustration. And then they were given another room with all kinds of toys for twenty minutes they could play and there we also had a Bobo the doll was back. Now the group that had seen the adult in a kind of civilized manner they played nicely. The group who saw actually the adult being quite aggressive to the doll start also being more aggressive to the doll. They start copying this behavior also kicking and fighting with this doll. Now here the lesson learned of course is that by seeing someone else, a model you could say then people start copying this idea. In this case with Bobo the doll is they saw the adult in a certain way behaving towards this doll. Now important for us for behavior change is that we can have people learn things by pointing out other people who are capable of doing it or let them think about other people capable of doing this. And this helps because with the mastery experience it is quite difficult because then people have to experience already. But you could instead refer to other people who have been before. So peers that might already have quit smoking or became more active or changed their eating behavior. So this modeling can help in such a way therefore to improve people's self-efficacy that they believe they can do it and then instead also set themselves these goals. Okay. Back to the self-efficacy. Mastery experience we talked about. Social modeling. Now let's move to improving the physical and emotional state. So one important thing also when you consider yourself capable of this is also how you feel. Yes, if you feel upbeat you're more capable or willing to take up some kind of a challenge. If you're feeling depressed and down it's less likely that you want to do it. You're like, right, I don't want to do this anymore. Therefore important if you have people who might at some point in their behavior change feel a bit down and you ask them to do certain things and you really depend on the self-efficacy of them that you also consider to improve their mood. Also make them feel good. Otherwise they won't start. And sometimes that means that you also need to be physically healthy. Yes, so don't forget that when you try to improve people's self-efficacy. So the last one is verbal persuasion. So don't forget that one. Although mastery experience is much the most the dominant factor in the sense to improve self-efficacy verbal persuasion can also be used just by someone who's important to a person tells them you can do it. I believe in you and these kinds of things that can help people's self-efficacy. Actually, we did one experiment in 2015. I think it's with Chow, we published this one. You could actually do this with virtual characters. So what we did in that experiment was we created a virtual classroom and Chow, you were sitting in the classroom and it was an English classroom and Chow asked people to just sit there and then play along when the teacher would give you a turn to say something in English. But before it started two other virtual classmates also got a task to say something in English a turn. And the fun thing what was happening there was also that these virtual characters were gossiping. So they would say, oh, that's a good answer or that's not that good. And when you say something those virtual characters were also saying this kind of things like, oh, really a good answer. Wonderful. Or, geez, that's a stupid answer. And then we asked people about their self-efficacy how capable they would be in the real world to act in such in class to say something in English. And depending on how those virtual characters the computer in a sense had gossip about them it influenced their self-efficacy. Yes. So this persuasive verbal persuasion is actually something you should consider. Yes. Because even if it is a computer even people in the virtual reality know that we're not real characters or real humans. They were still influenced by their persuasive comments. Yeah. So that's also one way to improve or in this case reduce self-efficacy. Okay. Then the last part of this lecture I'll quickly also turn to self-regulation. Because what you can do also is use all those things we've been talking about in all these videos about learning. You can actively use that to regulate yourself. Yes. Because for some time it's difficult for people if they change their behavior because in the future you get your reward and now you have to go to some hard shipper to get this kind of thing. But you can train or use all these kinds of tricks or principles to influence someone else because we're trying to make a rat learn or see how children learn. But you can also use that the techniques on yourself. So you could set for example self-monitoring. Monitoring. That's what I was looking for. So how well am I capable? How much progress I make? That helps you. Also setting goals. We've seen by goal setting you can set goals for yourself or help your user with your application to set their goals. Feedback. You can try to collect feedback on how well you do this. Give yourself rewards. Doesn't always have to be someone else to give it. You can also give yourself rewards if you do something. Self-instruction. That's often what people usually do if they have to do something they talk to themselves. I can do this. I really can do it. So this kind of persuasive element but then towards yourself. And you could also ask help from other people. Create your social support. Now, therefore, all these kind of learning strategies you can also use to regulate yourself and to help you to achieve things. Okay. So that was this video. And we talked specifically about self-efficacy because self-efficacy is an influencer to setting goals that people actually will consider to do something. And there were four things to improve self-efficacy. Mastery experience. So give people an experience that they are capable of doing it. If they've done it in the past, they are more confident that they can do it in the future, the next time. Social modeling. Viscarious experience. If you see someone else who's almost like you can do it, you are more convinced that you can do it also. Also, your self-efficacy you get a boost if you feel good and you're also in good physical shape and emotionally feel up. And verbal persuasion. Yes, if important people say to you, you can do it, it also helps you to boost a bit your self-efficacy. I hope you enjoyed this video and see you in the next one.
