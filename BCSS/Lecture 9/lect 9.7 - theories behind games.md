Summary:

The video lecture discusses the theoretical ideas behind the success of games, particularly in the context of gamification. The professor covers four key theories:

1. Motivation: Games are effective in motivating people due to their intrinsic nature. Theories such as goal-setting and self-determination emphasize the importance of challenge, curiosity, control, competition, and acknowledgment in creating motivation within games.

2. Learning and Retention: Games facilitate learning through repetitive practice, which aids in memory retention. Mass practice (cramming) can be effective for short-term recall, while distributed practice techniques (spreading out study sessions) lead to better long-term retention. This is comparable to game experiences that require players to develop skills over time.

3. Scaffolding: This educational strategy involves providing initial support to students or players, which is gradually withdrawn as their competence increases. An example is the progressively complex interface in games like World of Warcraft that adapts as players improve.

4. Episodic Memory: Games can effectively use episodic memory by creating situations that resemble real-life scenarios where players will need to recall information. An example given is the Stress Resilient Virtual Environment (STRIVE), which trains soldiers in stress resilience by simulating real-life combat scenarios.

The effectiveness of games in learning was demonstrated by a meta-analysis by Vogel et al., which found that:
- Computer games and simulations generally result in greater cognitive gains and more positive attitudes towards learning compared to traditional classroom teaching.
- Greater control within games correlates with better learning outcomes.
- Even low-fidelity games show some advantages over traditional methods, with high-fidelity games yielding even more significant knowledge gains.

The lecture ends by noting these findings demonstrate the substantial educational value of gamification and the utilization of games for learning purposes.

Theories behind games. In this video we continue our discussion about gamification but now we're going to look at the theory, the theoretical ideas behind the game and why they are so successful. So after this video you should explain at least four theories, ideas in a sense behind games, the success. So let's start. So first is motivation. An important part of games why they are so successful is the way to motivate people. And there are some taxonomies to explain why games are intrinsic motivated. So let's look first on, from Leppe and Maloon, is the internal motivation. With a game you set a challenge in terms of goals, certain outcomes and the game goal setting theory. We have seen that that might be very helpful. Goals of games also support curiosity and you explore something. You try to figure something out how it works. So that might also support this kind of motivation to do something. Control. We have seen about self-determination theory that the control part, that you determine you are in control in the situation you are in. Now in a game if you offer more control it's more fun because you determine the direction in the game. And it's part of fantasy which can also help. So it connects to the emotion and the cognitive experience. Also motivation is again, we talked about the cooperation and competition that you create between people. Creating a competition can be motivation, competition. And the game gives also people acknowledgement about what they achieve, their effort in achieving this. So that can all elements that drive the motivation of doing games. Another thing in games is also how learning is being developed. So in a game, for example, you do it over multiple times. You practice over multiple times. And that helps for retention. That when you come back and play again, then you improve your level of skill. Now, so if you look at learning, you can say you can do a mass practice technique or distributed practice technique. So let's take preparing for your exam. If you are a student that is, look, one day or two evenings before the exams, I kind of sit down and prepare for my exam and you do a kind of a mass practice technique. In one short time, you go to everything and then cram it in. Now that works if you have the exam two days later. So however, if you then do this exercise, but your exam is like five weeks later, you might have forgot everything already. Yes. So this time delay between when you train yourself and you test yourself, if that gets bigger, you see this retention of recalling this information dropping exponentially as a power function. Now, what you can do to make it last longer, this recall that over time you can still do it, is that you distribute the practice. So don't practice one, two days before the exam, but stretch it out over three or four weeks and every day or you do a little bit. And the more time you spread this information, this practice, then if you then have the exam much later, you have a higher chance that you recall everything because the practice has been distributed now. In a game, you can see this also. Yes. If it is a game you can experience and play over multiple days and weeks, then you get this experience going up in your skill set. Okay. So that's one theory behind the games. Scaffolding. That's another theory which you see often. Now, scaffolding is a process in where a teacher or a game support a student cognitively to motivate them, but also help them cognitively to develop, to be able to do a certain task on their own. Yes. So think about it. If a bicycle, you have the side wheels. If you are very young and it's first time you cycle and later, if you are much more mature, you can remove one of the side wheels. You can still try and then the other one. Yes. Now that is scaffolding. So you create a situation. Initially, you offer lots of support and along if people start developing experience, you redraw the support so that the people can be autonomous, can do it on their own. Yes. So that is one strategy and you see it sometimes I understand in the world of Warcraft that the interface becomes gradually more complex if you become more capable. So that's a strategy that you see in games. Another important theory behind game is the idea of using episodic memory. So episodic memory is autobiographical events. So you have from the event that you experience yourself in your real day life. There was a certain location, certain people were there. So these are memories of yourself. Now, interestingly, these episodic memories are also if you learn something this way, if you have cues that put you in the same kind of situation, then you have again much easily access to this information. Okay. So how does this work then for games? So for games, if you can create a situation what looks very much at the situation that you might be in the future, when you need this information, then you have easily access. Now let's point to an example here that is the Stress Resilient Virtual Environment, STRIVE, that University of South California Institute of Creative Technology made. And so they make this application for soldiers to experience. So they want to train their resilience. But what they want that people were in this resilience, for example, how to do taking breath and breathing to control your stress. So you can train people just in an abstract room and just say, let's do the breathing exercises. But no, they thought, you need to be capable when you are in a stressful situation that you have access to the information of how you do your breathing exercises. So what they created was a virtual environment and created a scenario. So in this scenario, you were there with your team going on a mission and during the mission, something go horribly wrong. Yes, something exploded and people died in the virtual environment. But then when you're in the stressful situation in this thing, the trainer steps in and start explaining how to do the breathing exercises. Yes, and explaining how you had to deal with stress in these environments. Here you see, you create first the environment, all those cues that you are there on patrol with the other soldiers. You have a certain creative crisis at hand. Now you would normally need to do these breathing exercises to keep yourself focusing and under control. And that is the moment that people start doing the training. Yes. So here you support this idea of this episodic memory support. Okay. Now, what have we learned over the years about the effectiveness of games? Now, Vogel and others, they did a meta-analysis, looked at 32 studies on computer gaming simulations and compared it with the more traditional classroom teaching. And here are three major findings. So the game interactive simulations were more dominant in gaining most cognitive gain outcomes and attitude towards the learning objective. So they were more dominant than the traditional classroom. This dominant, or the difference between the classroom and the computer game, was lessened if the games offered less control. So giving more control improved this, it seems, the effect of the game. Still, they found even in low-fidelity games, there was still this little bit of dominance compared to the traditional classroom. But if you increase the fidelity to make this like a nice working high-end game, then this knowledge gain is bigger. Okay, I hope you enjoyed this video and see you in the next one.
