Summary of Video Lecture: Reviewing Interface Design

1. Purpose: The lecture aims to teach students how to review a prototype for weaknesses and identify opportunities for improvement with respect to the users' interaction and experience.

2. Structure: 
   - Review process consists of two steps: 
     1. Overall review - focuses on addressing significant issues within the prototype.
     2. Identifying tactical opportunities - targets smaller, actionable improvements.

3. Overall Review:
   - Assess the prototype's structure, environment, and user preparation.
   - Ensure that the system offers clear value to the user that motivates behavior.
   - Tailor actions within the prototype based on the user's existing knowledge and experience.
   - Determine if interactions align with the minimum viable action required for change.
   - Evaluate if system interactions can be simplified or set to default.
   - Check for methods to develop habit formation and clear, feasible communication.

4. Constructing the Environment:
   - Consider the physical and social environment and its influence on motivation.
   - Confirm that only one action is requested at a time for clarity.
   - Provide feedback for long tasks to show progress.
   - Reduce distractions that could divert attention from the desired behavior.

5. Preparing the User:
   - Confirm that the interface aligns with the user's self-concept and is familiar.
   - Ensure the user knows what is needed for the task outside the application.

6. Tactical Opportunities:
   - Refer to the action funnel, analyzing the cue, reaction, evaluation, ability, and timing.
   - Make cues clear and actionable.
   - Increase trust with professional designs and authenticity.
   - Use biases to rationalize actions, like leveraging loss aversion or scarcity.
   - Enhance the userâ€™s ability by reducing constraints and simplifying procedures.
   - Use timing to create urgency for immediate action rather than postponement.

7. Conclusion:
   - The lecture instructs students to first solve fundamental problems and ensure the prototype communicates clear value to the user.
   - Secondly, fine-tune the prototype by examining it through the lens of the action funnel to encourage user behavior.
   - The instructor emphasizes the importance of understanding the user's needs, experiences, and the context in which the behavior change will occur.

## Transcript

Reviewing the interface design. In this video we'll talk about how we can review the prototype and see where there are weaknesses and ways to improve it. So after this video you should be able to do that, to do this reviewing. In the first edition of Wendel this was described in chapter 10, reviewing and fleshing out the interface design. Elements of what is written in chapter 10 in the first edition you can also see in chapter 10 in the second edition. But that might be more the core ideas instead of setting it in a kind of a review of your prototype. So we will be using it as a way to review it. So two steps in the review process. First we have step one is the overall review. And then in step two we're going to look at additional tactical opportunities. So overall review is about solving big problems with your interface, your prototype. So for example, at some point the system asks people to do something and people see no particular motivation and value of doing this. So imagine that you ask them to stop smoking and they cannot see the value for now. What is the benefit bringing that to me? So here you have then a problem that there's no value to it for the things you ask now. Big problem because that's likely unlikely that you will achieve then what you set out to do this behavior. So by analyzing this problem, we're going to do it as we've done in the previous video. We're going to look at the structure of the action, the behavior plan again, how you have constructed the environment where the action takes place and also the preparation of the user. Yes, so the structure, the environment and the user. That's what we're going to look at. Now let's start with the structure of the action itself. How can these things be tailored to a better leverage of existing knowledge and experience of the user? Yes, so if you ask people things that they have no clue doing that, then you have a problem. So if you all of a sudden ask, now let's think about it. Oh yeah, so kidney transplant management. So people sit at home and they have to take a little bit of their blood for an analysis for themselves. If they haven't done that before, they have no clue what you're asking. Yes, so if you just say do this and do that, then there's a problem. So there needs to be something to help them to get to this experience and this knowledge. So maybe in your behavior plan, there might be something that you have to do already first as a trial in the hospital with a nurse there so you can make some experience before you go home and do it on your own. Yes, now that can be something. Another thing, do your interaction also link up with a minimal viable action? So you remember minimal viable action are the steps needed, definitely needed to see the change that you want to accomplish. At least the behavior that you need that lines up in the end to the ultimate complete behavior change. If those screens are not matching, then maybe you are asking too little. Maybe there's part missing to create this kind of minimal viable action or there's too much. And maybe you can simplify the process. Maybe there are too many interactions actually needed to remove. And instead of removing, you can also have simplified the process. So look again at your prototype. Is there a way to cheat? Does the person have to do all this stuff? Can it be a default option that they move along without you? They have to do all the interaction, make decisions and to learn things. And can the system automatically do it? And remember when we talked about this Obamacare where people had to look up the telephone numbers of the radio stations. Can the system do that for them? Instead of explaining to them how to search the Internet for a radio station and why they might find on the website of the radio station likely see telephone numbers. Can you take that away that they don't have to do this task? Repeating, is it something that they have to redo again? Can you develop a habit? We talked about that. And is it also communicate? Here, let's read the point. In each action required clear communication to the user. Does it appear feasible up front from the perspective of the user experience the product? Yes. So do they think they can do it? Because if they think they cannot do it, remember we talked about the Fock model and its motivation capability. If they think they cannot do it, unlikely to do it. So how do we build this kind of confidence in that? If that might be a problem, then maybe somewhere in the task, you have to train them or help them to get this kind of experience that they see this task as feasible when they get to this point in your behavior plan. Okay, so that was reviewing the prototype in the context of your behavior plan and also think about whether your behavior plan is actually good enough because now you can actually see the thing with the prototype, what it actually means, the behavior plan, if you see it now with the implementation into your prototype. Okay, let's move to constructing the environment we talked about. Because this behavior change is set in an environment that could be the physical environment, social environment, and part of the environment could actually also be your behavior change support system. Now, first question, are people continuous motivated? Yes, if people have to make those daily, take those blood samples, analysis, are they motivated to do this every day or don't they see the point of it? Yes, so that's important. And are they continuous or moving to the next step? If it is, you have to ask them to do something of a whole training of an hour. Are they keep on motivated to continue or halfway which I don't like it anymore? Bye. Yes. Also, is your interaction with the user clear? So if you communicate to your system, are you only asking one thing at a time? Because if you're asking, right, measure your blood and by the way, enter it in the system, actually, there are two steps that you have to do the first, then the other. So don't ask at the same time. First, ask one when that's completed, then the next thing. Yes, don't confuse the person. So make it simple. If the task is long, if you ask them to do things for a longer time, provide them feedback so they know they're on the right track. Yes. So if they are running or walking, give them feedback about how much steps they are taking, how close are they towards this goal? If they have no clue and they have to walk all day and the end of the day, it's revealed. Yes, that doesn't help. Is it only in the end of the day you know where you achieve it? Yeah. So think about the goal setting, more feedback. If you're on your way, it helps people to continue towards that goal. And distraction. Consider is a distraction in the environment or for example, even distraction in your application. Try to reduce that. Yes. Because distraction means that people start focusing their attention on something else. Something else meaning not your behavior change that you want to help them to achieve. Okay. Now, from the environment, move on to preparing the user. Yes. So another important part is to prepare the user for the transition before they actually commerce on changing their behavior. Now, again, take your persona and look from the persona perspective to your interface, from your prototype. Is this idea matching with this person's self-concept? Is this how the person views himself? And could you imagine that they would actually use such an interface? Does it match? Is it not? Then you have to do something. Does it look familiar for the persona or is it a complete alien kind of design where they might not use these kind of fancy interaction tools that you might be using or it looks they're familiar with other systems. For example, if you're a student, is this kind of structure familiar looking at the system application that the university already would be offering? Then they could say, all right, I know how to use this. Then it's an easy, simple thing. I see how I can use this. Each time you ask them to learn a complete new environment, again, you create and make it more difficult obstacles. So see if it is familiar. Do they know what is needed? So if you ask them to do other things outside your application, again, think about the running. Do they have the shoes? Do they know which time? These kind of thing. Is this taken care of or do you leave it to the user to prepare? And if they don't prepare for it, then they might not do it. Again, look at your prototype for these things. All right. So these were step one, the big things. Now reviewing for technical opportunities. So maybe if you go to your prototype again, you see little pieces and things that you think, all right, if I add this to it, it might help. All right. Now to do this again, we go back to the action funnel, create, where people go through, you have the queue, the reaction, the evaluation, the ability and the timing of the queue. Now take this again and look at your prototype. Is it the right queue? Is it calling for an action? Do people know what is expected of them? Yeah. So if it is very clear what's expected to them, they may have a higher chance of doing it. And there should also no distraction. Clear pace. You have to do this. You have to now measure your blood pressure. You have now enter your past experience in your PTSD. What was the memory we were talking about? Yeah. So clear actions, what is expected. So Dustin Kirsten did a little experiment, I understand, about getting more people to follow him on Twitter. And he had different ways of asking this. So one way was, I'm on Twitter. This resulted in 4.7 or something percent of reader extra clicks clicking on this. Follow me on Twitter. You already say follow. Now you give it a bit of an action what you expect. All right. 7.3 percent. Making it much more explicit. You should follow me on Twitter here. 12 percent. So you see, by being very explicit, the action that is required, it helps people to understand what you're asking and not guessing that. Because if there's guessing involved, yeah, lots of people guess wrongly. So is there a queue? Make clear that you understand what the queue means and what they have to do. Reaction. If we go further to the funnel. The reaction was this gut feeling, system one idea. Now, does it increase the trust? If you look at this, the system itself, do you think, all right, I can trust it. So if the system looked professional and beautiful, we mentioned already, I mentioned in a previous video, had this hello effect that people think, all right, then the whole system might be trusted. Do you think the system might know what it's talking about? Yes. Increase the trust. We talked about it. Social proof. Do others also use it or recommend it? That helps also. And does the system show authority about the subject? Yes. Or does it look like, all right, they also don't know what they're talking about. So these can increase the subject authority. And also make this connection. Authenticity and personal. Make sure that they understand that it's tailored to them. It's for them and their situation. And the information there is genuine. It's authentic and not just, all right, some general story. And people say, all right, that's not for me. So the example here is this website. For some people, if you look at this, it might not be like, this seems very professional. So it seems a bit of a mess. Therefore, I don't trust with this website, we'll be saying yes. So think about the message is sent. If it doesn't look like a trustworthy, professional outlook. So it doesn't have that. Okay, then evaluation. Now the more system two, the rational things. Now we have all kinds of biases in people, which we can use to increase this. So prime the user relevant association we talked about. So the association for bruising your teeth we talked about, it could be the association with fresh breath instead of, all right, it's longer future things, increasing the dental health. Yes, and the association with walking, running, you're already doing walking. So running is a bit of a jogging, walking, you're already doing it. So associated with something they already do. Another trick was leverage the lost aversion. Remember, almost like a one point, one dollar lost is like a half a dollar winced. Yeah, you're getting. So taking something away from people, people really don't like, yes. So there's a much stronger cue. Peer comparison helps from people. Competition also helps. And also this scarcity. Here is avoid direct payment, but scarcity means we have seen also with one of the psychological ways to persuade people. If you can get this reward only in a limited situation, or you have to be quick to get this reward, all right, people might be running harder. Also reduce the cost that people have to make. To do the actions. The cognitive overload. And if it's too complex, can you make it simpler? And avoid choice overload. So if you have all many options and choices that people can make, they might be overwhelmed and then run away just because you have to think about to make so many choices. So keep it simple. Narrow it down and narrow it down to the choices that are relevant for those individuals. Yeah. Okay, then we go to the ability. Can we help them with the logistic of doing the action? Remember this implementation intention that you have this practicing with people beforehand. If I come into my room and I see the vacuum cleaner, I will clean my room. So if this happens, I will do this. So these kinds of almost monomics that you have in your mind, you prepare people then. It's easier to execute later on. Also decrease the constraints. Make something default that people don't have to think, but they have the option to change it. And I mentioned already the option of cheating, that they don't have to do it, and that the system is doing it automatically for them. All right, consider that. And also the ability we talked about, self-efficacy. Yes. Because if people don't think they can do it, they will not do that. They don't even set this goal. So show that other peers can do it, that people like them were able to do this. Then they might think, all right, if they can do it, I can do it. Now, there's one strategy for the self-efficacy to improve this Fiskerian experience, which you give them. The senior experience of someone else that you can then map on your own. And timing. Again, the last part of the funnel. Look at your prototype and when the information is given. Is there a sense to increase the urgency? They have to do it now and not later to postpone it. And think again about, here you could say there's short-sightedness, that people want to get benefits in the now. So it's very difficult to put your money aside for your in the future, or brush your teeth for maybe pain, and tooth problems you might have in the future. Yes. So try to turn it into the now. Again, as I said, with tooth brushing, it's now about the fresh breath and feeling clean. So that's a reward in the now. So remind people about the things they get here, instead of, yes, if you do this in the future, you will get it. Same with smoking. If you stop smoking, and avoid all those horrible diseases that you might end up in the future. You can always talk about now, the benefits. Yes. You feel much fitter, the money you are winning, because you don't have to buy all the secrets. And you also have much breath, fresher, your clothes, all these kinds of benefits. Your clothes are not less smelly, these kinds of things. Also think about your prior commitment. Yeah. We talked about people want to be consistent. So tell them you make this commitment. And if you want to be consistent, you now have to act. Otherwise you're inconsistent with people don't like. And which you mentioned already, scarcity can sometimes help. Or if you don't do it now, you miss out on the opportunities. So it's now. So that creates again the urgency. Okay. What's talking about this reviewing of your prototype. Again, first step is the overall review. The bigger picture. Is there some really big problem that people can't see the value of it? Why they should do it? The value for the user is not clear and communicated. Give them a problem with motivation. For the overall overview, we looked at the structure of the action, the environment, how it's constructed, the destructors, these kinds of things. Again, can you remove that? And then preparing the user. In your behavior plan, is the user aligned with the actions they have to take? Are they prepared? Do they have the knowledge and the self-efficacy that they feel they can do it? Then you go for the second evaluation and that's the more technical opportunities. Can you improve certain points to make the chance much higher that people will actually do the behavior or succeed in doing it? That's the second step of the evaluation. I hope you enjoyed the video and see you in the next one.
