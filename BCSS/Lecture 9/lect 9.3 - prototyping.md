Summary:

**Prototyping**

*Definition:*
Prototyping is the process of creating a preliminary model of a product to test and refine its functionality, design, and usability.

*Types of Prototypes:*
1. Horizontal Prototype: Offers a broad view of the entire system's range of functions without fully implementing them.
2. Vertical Prototype: Focuses on fully implementing a single function, with other features not yet operational.
3. Disposable Prototype: Created for quick testing and evaluation, meant to be discarded as iterations improve.
4. Incremental Prototype: Begins with a core part of the system which is incrementally expanded upon until it evolves into the full system.

*Fidelity Levels:*
1. High-Fidelity Prototype: Looks very much like the final product, is used for detailed evaluation, and is usually developed later in the design process.
2. Low-Fidelity Prototype: Appears very different from the final product, is quick to produce, easy to change, and is used to convey concepts and encourage input.

*Pros and Cons:*
- High-Fidelity Prototypes can set unrealistic expectations, are costly to produce, and can make stakeholders reluctant to suggest changes.
- Low-Fidelity Prototypes facilitate communication, invite feedback and modifications, and are ideal for early concept validation.

*Examples from the Lecture:*
- PTSD therapy interface and kidney transplant patient system were explored with sketches and feedback from end users was incorporated.
- E-partner and trauma appraisal training shown through paper representations for interactive discussions and improvements.

*Using Prototypes:*
Prototypes help gauge user experience, adherence to motivational and usability goals, and provide insights before investing in development.

*Considerations for Evaluation:*
- Ensure the prototype aligns with the desired user experience.
- Evaluate if the experience caters to user's prior knowledge and skills.
- Consider aesthetics, as visually appealing designs can imply higher quality and functionality (halo effect).
- Focus not just on usability but also on the overall experience and attractiveness of the product.

*Tools:*
Wireframe tools, like Pencil or Balsamiq, can be used for digital low-fidelity prototyping. They allow for quick iterations and interactive prototypes.

*Conclusion:*
Early-stage prototyping, especially low-fidelity, is essential for evaluating and refining ideas. As development progresses, higher fidelity prototypes become more useful for detailed assessments and stakeholder presentations.

Prototyping. In this video I will look at prototyping, how you can make a prototype, and so after this video you should be able to start building a prototype. This video is linked with chapter 9 from the first edition of the book, moving from the conceptual design to the interface design, but it also stands a bit on its own. We're going to look at, for example, examples from my own research where we made prototypes. There are different types of prototypes. Often there are different classifications of prototypes, so for example you have the vertical or the horizontal prototype. Now with a horizontal prototype you think about a prototype which has lots of different functionalities, so you can search between all those functionalities, but you cannot actually try one functionality. The more vertical, in that case you only have one functionality, but the whole functionality actually works. Other features and functionality don't work yet. So that's the distinction between the two types of prototypes. Do you have, for example, a whole menu structure and interaction there, but the system cannot do actually anything, but you can already have a feel of the interaction, how it might work, or is it that you want to test one particular functionality of the system, but you don't test the other interaction with the other stuff, then you have a kind of vertical. Another thing to consider is the distinction between a disposable and incremental kind of prototypes. So one strategy you see often is to build a prototype, evaluate it, throw the prototype away, and then start building a better prototype, throw that one away after the evaluation, and at some point start really developing the system. These are kind of disposable prototypes with multiple variations have been made, have multiple prototypes. You can also do to compare prototype 1 and B or C. These are mainly there for inspiration, exploration, studying, but not for the actual design of and developing the code. Now the incremental prototypes are a different beast. Here you start maybe from one part of the system, for example a very vertical prototype, already implementing everything, and bit by bit you extend the system around that. So you really build the system, but you start with a kind of a very small part of the system, which you then present as a prototype. So these prototypes are not thrown away, but gradually transform into the system itself. So consider that when you start developing prototypes, which one are you actually building? Because if you're going to make an incremental prototype, then you have to start and also consider about the reliability of your code, the readability, the maintenance of your code. But if you throw them away, that might be less important. Okay, another thing looking at prototypes that you see is the high and the low fidelity prototype. So high means it really looks as the whole outlook of the system is already there, and people might almost be fooled in that the system is really there. Low fidelity prototype is not, it clearly shows this is not the real product. Yeah, now what are the pros and cons of that to consider? Now let's start with a high fidelity prototype. Here you can use it for, since it looks really like the end product, you can use it for detailed evaluation, because you can see how people using it, how they interact, and you have really a key for all small details. Now these kinds of prototypes are of course important when you try to get acceptance from the client. Yes, because now it is clearly you show them what the product will be looking like. Most of the time, these kinds of highly high fidelity prototypes can only make in a later state of your project, because then you have a clear idea how it looks like, and so in the beginning you might be unable to do that. Now there are serious drawbacks in waiting so long and only building high validity prototypes. The drawback might be is that if you have a high fidelity prototype, your client might not be able to distinguish between the real product and the prototype. For them, it might look like this is the real product. So if you present them with a high fidelity prototype, they think it's finished, or you will be launching your product within a couple of weeks, where you might still say, no, no, no, we still have to do the whole back end. Yeah, so that raises expectations. And also, if you want to use a high fidelity prototype just to evaluate the general idea, yeah, you sent the wrong message, because now you have a very detailed prototype, and then people start focusing on the very details, where, yeah, if you want to have an evaluation of the general ideas, they might miss out of that. Of course, it takes much time and effort to develop this thing, so that's quite different. And it's also, in a sense, making drastic changes is different in two ways, because it takes time and effort again. And also, if you evaluate it, clients, for example, might also hesitate to be very critical, since they know you spent so much time on it, and they think, all right, this is almost to the end, we have no room anymore for criticizing. Yes, so it doesn't like invent people to start be critical and come up with alternatives. Now, let's move then to the low fidelity prototypes, and you can already see it is a bit of a difference. Could be a pen, sketch, and clearly show to people, right, we make this up in an hour, our time. So it's only there, put forward the general idea, and also inviting people to say, all right, we don't like it, let's change it, because they know, we don't hurt your feelings too much, you only spent an hour on this, just to convey an idea and a concept. Yes, so it is really inviting and stimulating for reflection and consider different ideas. And also invite modification, because now let's change this or that. And it's also easy to make multiple versions to call to really reflect on the different ideas that are possible. So low fidelity prototype is very keen or important, for example, to use very early on in the project, because it's easy to make, easy to change, and good to communicate with clients and potential users about what your ideas are. Now, let's look at some low fidelity prototypes from our own research. So one, for example, was for the PTSD therapy. We sketched out a number of screen designs, and this we used to discuss the setting or the design of the system with the therapists, so they could understand what we were babbling and raving about, because now it became concrete. So we had multiple screens to explain what we want to do, and they can then say, right now, this is not right, maybe you should get this in a less prominent place. But at least we now were very concrete in discussing what the system would be looking like, which is helpful, because people have a problem to understand these abstract constructs or the list of piece of papers with description and specification. Now, this prototype at the end resulted in this, but still a prototype, you could say, final system, which was evaluated also with end users. Now, let's move to another example, and that was a behavior change support system to help renal transplant patients who had transplanted their kidney to manage after the operation for a year their health. And here you could see we had sketches, ideas about how the interface might be looking like. And here we also talked about width in a focus group with patients groups, and they pointed out weakness and strong parts of the interface, which we could then change also. Another example is this e-partner for families. Very simple piece of paper, sketching out how the mobile phone app would be look like, and how children in a family or parents would communicate with each other. Again, we were very interactive, people could press the paper buttons and see what happened then, and which was helpful again to flesh out ideas that we had in the beginning, which were not maybe applicable. Another example was a system that we made for, again, for soldiers, but also firefighters, for appraisal training to prepare themselves for traumatic events. And in this setting that we developed was that they looked at videos and start appraising, writing down what the thoughts are about these videos. So, and in this video, we could, for example, show news reports of traumatic events. Now, this was the first sketch that we came up with. This was the next one, and you see it is now extended also with a virtual character on the left that we want to include to help people go through all these steps in the training. And here's the ultimate, the final prototype that we also again use to evaluate with end users. Yeah, so you see this process, developing things, moving around, incorporating new elements, but it allows you as a discussion piece to talk about with end users. It's not only that you can use it to talk about, you can actually also use those low-fidelity prototypes as a means to see how people interact with them. So, how to run a low-fidelity prototype is that you might be working with two people at the same time. So, we have pieces of paper and post-its, and that represents your interface. And then you ask people to do a certain task, and this person would say, all right, I would click on this, and so they then press on a piece of paper. And then the second person would then play the computer, would say, take the paper away, and say, all right, now the screen would look like this. And then the person, all right, that makes sense. Then the next step, I would click on this, and press again on a piece of paper, and then the person takes away the piece of paper, and puts another piece of paper, and show what would happen then. Now, this way, you can simulate the system in a sense by one person playing the computer, while another person talks to the person like, what are you thinking? Why did you do these kind of things? Yeah, and you can do this already very early on. You don't have to build anything, and you can already do a behavior study, how people interact with your system. Okay, so think about all these things very early on in your design process. When you start developing a product, you can already evaluate and see where the problems are. And this is important, because then you don't have to code, because once you start programming, you're committed, and you put effort in it. And we know already from, again, remember the hook model. Once you make an investment, whoo, it's very difficult to walk away from it. Now, we have the same problem. If we are the programmers, we build something, you invest it in it. You don't want to throw it away that easily. So postpone the investment, start working initially only with very low fidelity prototypes. It doesn't have to be always paper. You also have those wireframe tools, that quickly allow you to make the interface, and it looks quite reasonable already. You can also do a kind and make them interactive. There are flowcharts behind it. So here's an example of the pencil, evils, and vn. I have no clue what it is. It's a website, but you can download this wireframe tool to play around and build these systems already. So if you don't like the paper thing, you can also do it like this. All right. Now, once you have the prototype, you can start reflecting on this thing. So the first thing you could start thinking about is, does it really have the experience that I actually want to develop? Does this thing make sense? Does it motivate people the way you want it? Because in your previous analysis, you looked at what the motivational problems are, the goals, the obstacles. Now, is this experience that your prototype is providing, is that really matching? Is also the prior experience and knowledge matching? Do people know already how to use this interface? Or is the content enough that matches what people should be able to know already? Yeah. So now you can start seeing this perspective from a user's side and go through it. Also important is, a lot of people only focus on the usability, the ease of use, because we hammered on that. Hey, you remember Fox behavior model, the capability, motivation. So capability to make things easy enhances the chance that people will do it. But don't forget, it also helps to make it look pretty. Yes. If it looks beautiful, people might also incline to be using. Yes, it's more compelling to use. And also think about the hello effect and the hello for the saints on top of your head. If you have this hello around you, you apparently are some saint. So whatever you do, it's good. Now, the same thing with the hello effect is, if it looks beautiful, then it might also actually work better, because who would make a very beautiful system that doesn't work? So if they spend so much time on the beauty of it, you assume it also spent a lot of time about the functionality. Yes. So if it doesn't look very pretty, then people might deduce that, all right, I guess the functionality will also not work that well. Yeah. So keep that in mind. There's a kind of heuristics that people making, having, using to judge your system. And of course, still consider the experience and the usability of the system. Okay. That was a whole thing to talk about, about prototypes. Again, think about high fidelity and low fidelity. High fidelity, maybe you want to do a bit later on in your project. In the beginning, low fidelity, because it allows you to quickly maneuver from one idea to another and discuss this and also evaluate it with end user. And it doesn't have to be always paper. Wireframe tools are also available. I hope you enjoyed the video and see you in the next one.
