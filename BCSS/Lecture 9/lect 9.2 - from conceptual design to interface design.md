**Summary of Lecture on Translating Behavior Plans into Interface Design:**

**Objective:**
- To understand how to convert a behavior plan into user stories and design patterns for Behavior Change Support Systems (BCSS).
- Main reference: Chapter 9 of the first edition of Wendel's book.

**Behavior Plan:**
- A journey outline of how individuals change their behavior.
- Includes preparation, developing habits, and transitioning to maintenance phase as the new behavior is established.
- Identifies emotional highs and lows during the process.
- Highlights touchpoints where the system might provide beneficial support, especially during low points or barriers.

**User Stories:**
- User stories describe what the user wants to achieve at each touchpoint without specifying the product implementation.
- They express the user's goals and the reasons behind them.
- User stories help to connect the behavior plan to the system development process.

**Design Patterns:**
- Patterns are template ideas for design and are categorized into high-touch and low-touch approaches.

**High-Touch Approaches:**
1. Decision-making support: Tools to aid users in making decisions (e.g., Hello Wallet or Pocket Negotiator).
2. Behavior change as a game: Using serious games to drive behavior change. 
3. Gamification: Incorporating game elements into non-game contexts to motivate behavior.
4. Planner: Applications that help users set and track goals.
5. Reminders: Tools to remind users to perform tasks they may forget.
6. Social sharing: Sharing progress with a community to motivate and inspire.
7. Goal trackers: Apps that allow users to set and monitor progress towards goals (e.g., Fitbit).
8. Tutorials: Providing educational resources to teach new behaviors or concepts.

**Low-Touch Approaches:**
1. Appeal to think differently: Framing information in a new way to influence perception.
2. Call to action: Simple prompts to encourage immediate actions (e.g., donating, activism).
3. How-to tips: Regular tips to guide users through a behavior change process.
4. Reminders and planning prompts: Simple notifications to act as memory aids.
5. Status reports: Updates on relevant information or activities that keep users informed.

**Considerations for Pattern Selection:**
- Fit with organizational or personal culture.
- Consider the resources available and the engineering feasibility.
- Ensure chosen patterns will deliver effective results and are measurable.

**Conclusion:**
- The right design pattern choice depends on the behavior plan, user stories, culture, resources, and desired effectiveness.
- By linking the behavior plan to user stories and design patterns, you can develop a cohesive and effective BCSS.

## Transcript

From conceptual design to the interface design. In this video we're going to look at how we translate the behavior plan into ideas for the design of our system. So after this video you should be able to translate the behavior plan into user stories and also select some relevant design patterns for your behavior change support system. If we look at the book, this is mainly covered in the first edition of Wendel in chapter 9. In the second edition not much attention is given to what I'm now going to talk about in this lecture. So bear with me and let's see how we can change from the behavior plan to some parts that you start developing an actual system. So in the behavior plan in the previous video we talked about is that you write down a kind of a journey how people go about changing their behavior. So how they prepare for example, have the material there and then start to develop for example kind of a habit and how this support for creating habits fades out when it becomes a kind of a maintenance phase where they can do it. And along the way you would indicate the ups, the highs and lows of a person for example emotionally. Importantly in the behavior plan we see that we have touch points. Points where we think support system might be beneficial to have. Specifically at the points where people might bunch into a barrier, have those low points where they feel down or something. Here and there is something there you can help with the system. So those touch points. Now what you're going to do is to take those touch points and turn them into user stories. Explain here what the user wants to achieve at those touch points. And these are those little user stories. So we don't want to specify in our user story how the product will do this, but just explain what the user wants to do it. You can explain in those user stories a little bit of the why users want to do it. Now here are a number of examples. So on one hand for example, let me read out, you have a touch point which says product should trigger the user to act. For example, sending a reminder to run. Then the user story associated with this touch point is, as a user I want to be reminded when it's time to run so I don't procrastinate. So it tells you what the user wants, not how the system will do this. Take another one. The product should help users develop a self-narrative. For example, thinking about the previous times they are going to run. So that is the touch point description which is linked with the behavior plan. Now we translate that to a user story. As a user, I want to think about the previous time I've succeeded at running. So this new challenge doesn't seem to be so scary. And the last one, touch point tutorial is required about how to sync up the tracker. Then the user story again explains what the user wants and why. As a user, I want to know how to update my log online so my friends can react. Now I also stress here that I want to see these things in your coursework. That you make a connection between your behavior plan to the user stories because from there you can develop also the prototype. So you have a nice line that you can follow through your report that they understand how you came at the end to this product design. So because you can link it back and argue about it from your behavior plan but also your problem brief. So you can have this whole trail explaining the idea why you do this. Now once we have the touch points, it's time now to start thinking about the product itself. Of course it's a very creative process. You brainstorm, think about, look around. But one strategy of doing that is also to look at patterns. Ideas that have been described as a kind of a template idea that you might also want to use. Now in the first edition of Wendel, he presents a number of these patterns. And he categorized them in high-touch approach and low-touch approaches. So let's start with the high-touch approaches. These are approaches that more or less focus on the whole design of the application. And which also include lots of involvement of the user and the connection between the product and the behavior change. Now first of the patterns are decision-making support. So here you have tools that support people making decisions. So the whole tool is there to support decisions. Now we have seen on previous videos already how technology can be used to support decision-making. Here are two examples. So the Hello Wallet, when Wendel was involved, which helped people to manage their spending. And the other example from our own group is the Pocket Negotiator, which supports people to make decisions. But also a bit of negotiation when you buy or, for example, a house. Let's move to the next one. The next one is a high-touch approach, which is behavior change as a game. A serious game is a game which has a purpose other than entertainment. In this case for us is to change someone's behavior. And so this game approach is also very interesting. And we will talk about in a separate video much more detail about gamification. But here you could use a game settings to help people to change their behavior from one to another. It could, for example, be a media, if you see by behavioral technologies, to experience a setting or to learn the causal effect. The example here I show is from Clever, a company in Delft, which allow people with anxieties to travel on a bus and to learn how to act and to feel comfortable in public places. Now the last one, the next one, not the last one, there's a long list still, is gamification. So where in the behavior game, it's a whole game that you use. But gamification means that you put little elements in a context where not the whole context is a game. So you give them rewards, you add elements of competition in it. So these are kind of elements that you put around or in your tool or in your whole behavior plan. Now, one example is in The Bachelor, we have a computer organization course, which is transformed all these game elements. For all kinds of things you do in the course, you get points. And by doing all these elements, you get enough points, which helps you to pass the course. So you see, it really makes it in a game in which you have all kinds of elements that help you to, in a sense, learn the material. But with different routes you can take there. Another pattern is the planner. Often you will see in the behavior change applications that people have to plan or set goals or want to achieve something. So one pattern is about planning. The example here is WHOOP, which stands for helping people to rethink what they want to achieve. So first they have to have a state of wish, what do I want to get to? Then what are the exact outcomes? Then what is stopping me from that? And then the planning. Now, there are multiple ways of doing this. But the idea is seeing your behavior change plan or plan system as a planner is also a kind of a design pattern. Reminders is also something what your system can help people have to remind to do things. So people might be willing to do it, motivated to do it, but just they forget about it. Now, here the system can support people by giving reminders. This could be very to-do list apps, self-organization app, telephones which remind people. But you have whole application from Omnion Focus, for example, centered around this idea of having people get rid of all the things in their mind to keep remembering. I have to do this, this, this, put it in the system and the system helps them to organize and remind them. Okay, let's move on to another high touch approach, which is the social sharing. Lots of motivation can be achieved by sharing relevant information about the behavior with others. So people share with them what they try to achieve, which could be inspirational. So for example, here the runner keeper, which together for exercises, people do some running and then their friends can see what they have been doing and also comment on this thing. Yes, so here the social sharing is to encourage people to do the physical exercises. Call trackers. Call trackers, what you often see, we have seen in the call setting theory. If people set goals, they are specific, their performance is higher. Now with call settings is a kind of a paradigm that you support this idea. Let's set people, let's set goals and then track their progress. Fitbit is an example here. You can set your weekly, how many steps you want to do. And then it keeps track of how far you are reaching your goals. But the other one is the Dutch diet insight. You could say the diet insight, which you set goals of what you want to eat and how much you want to eat of these kinds of things. And then you keep track about what you actually been eating. Okay. Then and last behavior change high touch is, of course, the tutorials. People have to learn new behaviors. They might also need to learn really mentally the rational ideas about it, steps and articulate. Here you have the tutorials. And of course, one example is the MOOCs, Massive Open Online Courses. But you can also think about other kinds of courses and tutorials. These were all high touch approaches. Of course, you also have the low touch approaches. These are small ingredients you could say you can spread around and in your application just with not so much effort in a sense to develop. Now let's start with a very couple of low touch approaches. So the first one is an appeal to think differently. Yes. Just to have people frame it differently. They might look at things differently. We talked about that in the video about framing. For example, framing could mean that for an energy company, if you want to change people's energy consumption, you could, instead of seeing this like, all right, there's a bill. How much did I spend? You could create a kind of a competition or comparison by sending your bill information and showing how much others like you, for example, your neighbor have spent on their energy and make it in a sense a kind of a competition. So you frame it differently than something like, all right, this is how much you have to pay. You are all of a sudden in a kind of a competition and now you try to beat someone. Yes. That's framing. The call to action. Very simple low touch. If you want people to do something, remind them and make it easy to do something. Send them an email with a link to, for example, donate or send a letter to someone, a member of parliament. Yes. Very simple, but it's a call to action. How-to tips can also be very simple. Remind people or not to remind. Give them little bits of information each time and help them along the way in this process to change their behavior. So the example is text for baby where like future parents have to prepare for their first child and every week you give them a short tip on how to do this. Again, low touch, not too complicated, but could be quite effective. Reminders and planning prompts. We have seen in the high tech that you can build whole applications about planning and reminding. But the reminding itself can also be a simple element which you somewhere put in another application. So a very simple one. Remind your employees to take the flu vaccination or other people just, oh yeah, I have to do this. And the last one, status reports can also be a very lightweight approach. So state support. So just make people aware of what's going on. Keep them up to date. So the example here are the meetups in a community show. The activities that are going on and people who might be new and want to do something in the neighborhood. They can see what is happening there and they can join. Yes. So these are very minimal kinds of approaches. Now, if you think about which design pattern you want to pick, because these are just a number and it could be many more you can choose from, is to really think about how does it fit in the organization or the culture of the person. So we did some research about resilient training for the army. So we looked at various applications being developed for soldiers to train themselves how to deal with these kinds of psychological stressful situations if they're being deployed. And talking to all those designers and developers of these systems, we learned that four important things that you have to consider. One of them is culture. The army has a set of protocols, rules, a culture, how you do things. And you have to adjust and the system also has to fit that approach. So, for example, if you think about resilience, you can do yoga and meditation. But that might not be really a good selling point in an army setting. However, if you transform it into like a ninja preparing for going to battle, that sounds much more as a frame applicable to an army setting. Also, the culture. Is it something you do on your own or is it being introduced as this whole setting by a team member? Maybe an officer or enlisted officer introduced it. So then it's more acceptable. Now, this is important to understand because if it has a clash with the culture, that's what we learned from these developers. They say that it will not work. Also, of course, you have to think about your resources, how much money you have and also the engineering. Can you actually make this? Do you have enough resources and the efficiency of the effectiveness for in the army setting? It was very important to understand that you can convince people so that this will be effective. And how would you measure this? Yeah. So again, when selecting a design pattern, think about this. Now, let's round it up. So what did we see? We looked at the high touch and the low touch approaches. A number of patterns we have looked at. And at that stage, it might be interesting to look now. If you know your behavior plan, your user stories and anything. All right. Which of these kinds of patterns would be applicable in our case? Now, I hope you enjoy and see you in the next video.
