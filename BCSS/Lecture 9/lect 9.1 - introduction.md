Summary:

In this lecture, we cover aspects of interface design and gamification, drawing from Wendel's "Design for Behavior Change" (specifically chapters 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 of the second edition, and chapters 9 and 10 of the first edition). Key focus areas include:

1. Crafting the Intervention: Students should understand how to take a behavioral plan and put it into action via a product or service. This involves developing the design into a tangible offering.
2. Implementation: The process involves prototyping, connecting the product design to the behavioral plan discussed earlier, and preparing for deployment.
3. Impact Determination: While not covered in depth due to its connection with experimental design, it's important to note how to measure the success or effectiveness of the intervention.
4. Evaluation: We touch on the process of reviewing and refining a product post-implementation, although detailed evaluation techniques are not part of this course.

Additionally, students are expected to:
- Translate behavior plans into user stories that guide the design process.
- Create low-fidelity prototypes to visualize and test their interface designs.
- Review prototypes to ensure alignment with the initial behavior plans and objectives.
- Understand the principles of gamification and how to apply them to motivate users to change their behavior.

The lecture aims to equip students with the practical skills needed to move from conceptual designs to functional prototypes, with a particular emphasis on techniques to encourage user behavioral change.

## Transcript

Interface design and gamification. In this lecture we're going to look at several chapters at once. So if we look at Wendel, design for behavior change, the second edition. Then we're going to look at chapter 10, a little bit of 11, which we actually did already in the other lecture on conceptual design. Chapter 12, we will do chapter 13 and 15. And chapter 13, we will not really go in that depth as explained in the chapter as evaluation and setting up experiments is not part of discourse. So if we look at the design model, we're going to look at the crafting part, crafting the intervention, a little bit implementation with the product. So we're going to go a bit further than the book, look much more at prototyping and connecting it with a behavioral plan that we looked before at. Then determine the impact, we only touch that because that's more about the experimental design. And we also briefly talk about evaluation, the next step. If you look at the first edition of Wendel, we're going to look at chapter 9, moving from the conceptual design to the interface design. And chapter 10, reviewing and fleshing out the interface design. But we will do more in this lecture. We also at the end going to look specifically at gamification. One way of trying to motivate people to change their behavior. So in this lecture, if you've completed all the videos, you should be able to translate the behavior plan that we talked before into user stories. Then we also going to should be able to make some prototypes, low fidelity prototypes. And be also capable of reviewing the prototype back to all the behavior plans and the ideas that you had before. And also have an idea if you would actually implement it and release the product, how you could refine the steps. And as I mentioned before, we're going to look at the gamification principle. I hope you enjoy it. See you in the next video.
