### Summary: Introduction to Game Mechanics

#### Definitions:
- **Game:** A system with rules, interactivity, and feedback, leading to a quantifiable outcome and emotional reactions.
- **Gamification:** Applying game mechanics, aesthetics, and thinking to engage and motivate individuals for learning and problem-solving.
- **Serious Game:** A game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment, often for education or training, using game mechanics to enhance engagement.

#### 11 Game Mechanics from "The Gamification of Learning and Instruction" by Karl Kapp:

1. **Abstraction:** Simplifying complex real-world scenarios into a game environment to understand cause-and-effect relationships, excluding irrelevant factors to reduce learning time.
2. **Goals and Rules:** Providing motivation and productivity through set goals, offering freedom in achieving them, and governing the achievement with explicit and implicit rules.
3. **Conflict, Competition, Cooperation:** Structuring interactions as conflicts (win-lose), competitions (optimize personal performance), or cooperations (collective benefit) to align with the game’s objectives.
4. **Time:** Using time as a motivator and resource, managing it for completing tasks, and representing causal effects over a period within the game.
5. **Reward Structure:** Offering rewards like badges, points, and prizes based on player activities to maintain engagement, calibrated to the difficulty and relevance.
6. **Feedback:** Providing information on progress and performance with engaging and exciting feedback strategies that maintain player interest.
7. **Levels:** Dividing the game into sections to focus on subtasks, developing player skills progressively, and contributing to a narrative or storyline.
8. **Storytelling:** Incorporating narratives that provide meaning and a sense of experience, often reflecting the classic hero’s journey arc to maintain interest.
9. **Curve of Interest:** Keeping the game continuously engaging by introducing new scenes, challenges, or story elements to motivate progression.
10. **Aesthetics:** Making the game visually appealing to enhance the playing experience and motivation to continue engagement.
11. **Replayability:** Allowing for experimentation, failure, and retrying to encourage exploration and learning from different outcomes.

#### Conclusion:
The video concludes by emphasizing the importance of incorporating these mechanics into gamified systems such as educational courses or behavior change support systems. Players can benefit from games by having the freedom to fail, learn, and improve within a structured and enjoyable environment.

Gamification. In this video you will learn 11 game mechanics. We will be looking at the book that is the Gamification of Learning and Instruction by Carl Cobb that I will be using throughout this video on Gamification. Before we dive into the mechanics, let's focus on what is a game, gamification and series game. So a game, and I will read up the definition, is a system in which players engage in an abstract challenge defined by rules, interactivity and feedback that result in a quantifiable outcome, often elicit emotional reactions. So, it's a kind of an abstraction, you have to do something, play a game, not in the real world but in an abstraction of the real world. There are all kinds of rules that you have to follow. Often you play against someone else and at the end there is a clear goal that you achieve. And along the way lots of emotion, frustration, fun and joy can be elicited. Gamification is using game-based mechanics, aesthetics and game thinking to engage people, motivate and actions to promote learning and solving problems. So gamification is using those mechanics in, for example, learning. So gamifying your whole educational course you can do. Using this idea of gaming, so setting a goal and you get rewards and there are multiple ways in which you can achieve your goals. All gamification things you could, for example, do in your course. Series games. So series game, the word serious means that the game is not there to entertain you. Yes, that's not the purpose in a serious game. In a serious game the idea is that you accomplish some other task, maybe learning or a certain task that you have to do. But you use those game mechanics to make it more fun or engaging. Yes, so you use the mechanics in an application but the application itself objective is not entertainment. So that's a serious game. Okay, having that out of the way, let's move to the game mechanics. So in the book there are 11 game mechanics and let's start with the first one. Abstraction. So look at Monopoly. It's about real estate, hiring real estate or buying real estate. And instead of doing this in the real world, which is quite difficult. You can enjoy it by an abstraction of it. An abstraction of real estate management and people can play it. So you don't also have to deal with all the complexity of the real world real estate business. You have simplified it and let people then operate in the simplified version of this reality. The abstraction is still there to demonstrate or to experience the causal effect relationship. So what is the effect of buying houses? What is the effect of making the investment? What is the effect of renting things or going to jail? This you can all experience in an abstraction and you can see what happens. What is the effect if I do this or that? It can also remove factors that are not that relevant. Extraneous factors you could say. Because in normal life you have to do stuff which may be less relevant for real estate. You as a real estate might need a haircut, also need to sleep. This you can remove from the game to focus on the essence. It also reduces the learning time. If you would need to learn this all in real life it may take you 50 years to understand real estate management in the game. Much shorter in two hours monopoly you get an idea of what is happening there. So that's an idea of this abstraction, the possibility of the mechanics. Let's move on to goals and rules. Goal setting theory we all know that setting goals can help motivate and make people more productive. Goals are also set in a game. There is added a purpose to the game. In the end there is a kind of a measure to see whether you exceed that goal. It gives you also some freedom because there are multiple ways to achieve the goal. That makes it a bit fun because what you do helps you to achieve this goal or not. There is also a clear end to the game then. When it's finished and you achieve your goal. There are also rules that govern the way you can achieve this goal. You have the operational rules. How the game is played in a sense. The constructive rules. If you look at football. How the field is organized for example. Where are the goals. These kind of things. That's the structure of the game. You have the implicit rules. Things that's not most times written down but normally. If you are a football you might not start shouting immediately if you see an opponent. You might not talk that much. So there is a kind of implicit games etiquette. How you behave to other people. And the instructional rules that are stuff that you learn during the game. That could also help you maybe in real life. But it could also learn how you play actually football and kick around the ball. The other things in games mechanics is how you organize the game. Is the conflict, is the competition or cooperation. This setting really means different things. So in conflict the game is about you winning over the other. So to win the other has to lose. Competition is something I can do on my own and the others. But we try to optimize their own performance. I'm not trying to minimize the others performance. So if you have a running competition. I'm not trying to tackle the other person. Then it would be a kind of a conflict. I try to run as fast as possible. So I only focus on my own performance and have a look at the others. But I'm not trying to hinder the other one. Cooperation in a sense focuses the goal on a kind of mutual benefit. So by working together that is how we win. It really changes the setting. So if you want people to work together and learn working together in your game. Then you have to make sure that there is a cooperation. That there is a benefit for all of them to work together. If not, if you say you have to work together. But at the end one wins and the other has to lose. Then you in a sense creating a conflict. And don't encourage that they work together. So think about what your objective of the game is. If you want to create a setting where there is a real competition to motivate them. But you also want them to learn to work together. Then you have a bit of a conflict what you're going for. So think about it. Are you going for a conflict, competition or cooperation? Time. Time is also an important mechanism which you can use in a game. It could be a motivator. Like you're running out of time. You only have one minute to do something. All right, now you're spitting up. That makes also motivational things. Time can also be a resource. Yes, you have an hour but you have to do multiple things. Think about these games that you are locked in a room, an escape room. And you have to get out in an hour. Yes, the hour is the motivator. But you also have an hour to solve all kinds of riddles. So maybe one group member has to work on this part in the time. And 50% of your time you're also going to look at something else. Yes, so you have to manage your time. Causal effect. Time again. As you mentioned also, over time you can see things happening in a game. Yes, so again, it shows you if you do this, over time this will happen. So that allows you to learn how the causal effect is. And you can speed it up. If you look back to the monopoly, you don't have to wait to build everything and to really hire people and all this kind of thing. You can quickly do this and see how these connections are made between the cause and effect. Let's move on. Reward structure. In a game there are opportunities to reward people. Give them badges, points and prizes, etc. Now, that's also very helpful. We have seen that before in the hook model, that you give people rewards. Now, again, make it easy in the beginning to get rewards. Once people get hooked, you know already from the hook model, then in a game you might be a bit less giving away this reward. Make it a bit tougher. Make sure that you not give people the feeling that they can get rewards without doing any activity. So make clear there's a link between what they do and why they get the rewards. Yes, then they make the rewards relevant in a sense. Okay, the feedback. Important game mechanic. Give people information, how well they progress, how much they do things in the right way, are they on trajectory to achieve the goals. And also make the feedback a bit juicy, fun to see, engaging and exciting. Yes, so it could be a bit of a surprising feedback that helps people to go and keep their toes to do things. Now, there's a whole list here on the slide, which gives you all kinds of ways of doing it. Make it tactile, you can touch it. It's inviting, it's positive, this feedback. Repeatable, so you multiple times you get the feedback. Coherent, more is listed there, I'm not going to look at that all. Another game mechanic, levels. So game levels gives you the opportunity to break the game in pieces and focus on subsections. Yes, so first you have to do this, then you move to that and then to that. And by breaking it up, you can also create a kind of a storyline. The game levels can also help people to adopt their skills. Yes, you start maybe the first level a bit simple, capable to build more expertise, which then in the next game level you can challenge and make it more difficult. Yes, so you have the play levels, which could be the different degrees you have in your game and the player's level. How capable is the person to do the kind of things and how experienced is he or she becoming while playing the game. Storytelling, important things that could be in a game is to have meaning for what you're doing. There's a story to be told. So these games make it fun and also establish the idea of a scary experience. Your character or your role in the game, you experience things. And it has this connection also with storytelling from books and movies. And what you sometimes see in books and movies, and that you might copy also in your game, is what they're talking about, the hero's journey, which you see in movies quite often. So example, the hero's journeys, you will see this, for example, in Star Wars, The Matrix, The Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings. Now, so what is in a nutshell the hero story? Start always with someone who's a bit oblivious, live in some world where there's everything happening. Then the adventure starts into, all right, we didn't know that. And then it becomes into this new world, yes? And there's a mentor, yes? Which helped the person, the character, into this new world where they didn't know before, yes? So Star Wars, then Luke is introduced with the Force, The Matrix, Neo is explained, there is something like a matrix going on. Now, here, the mentor helps them, and they learn about their own powers. They are somehow special, and they can do certain things. And then during the journey, of course, is a bit of a rebirth happening, yes? Luke is recognizing himself, by God, I could be a Jedi, yes? So, and of course, some transformation then happens from I was ignorant in the beginning, now I'm becoming much more self-aware about this, and then maybe return again to their previous life with their new powers, but now know much more and able to do some stuff, yes? Now, this kind of story, hero stories, you might also see back in games. All right, now with this storyline, you can already see it makes it interesting, yes? You go from one phase to the other, which is keeping the curve of interest, which is also an important mechanic, yes? Keeping the game always interesting, to motivate people from one phase to the other, to keep on playing the games, yes? So, each time there is something else that you're showing. You see that in movies often, yes? That you see, all right, there's one scene, and then you have a kind of a cliffhanger, and then you want to continue the other one. So, yeah, each time there's a little bit that you want to keep on going. Now, in games, you can also do this, yes? Okay, aesthetics, the game itself can also be looking very visually beautiful, yes? That can also have an impact on the experience of playing the game. So, there's also something we mentioned before, also for behavioral change support systems, make it look beautiful, can also motivate people to continue it. Then, another important game mechanic is replay or do it over. Now, in a game, you can try things, and you could die in a game, and then get another life, yes? So, by helping people to experience and explore different things, and then say, all right, if you fail, it's not game over. No, you continue and try it again. Now, that's a very healthy, supportive mechanism to allow people to experience things and to see what happens if I do this or that or that. Now, that's a game mechanic that you might also want to use in your behavioral change support system, yes? Yes. So, that's where the 11 game mechanics, abstraction, goals and rules, the conflicts and competition and cooperation, the time, the reward structure that you can use, feedback during the game, how well am I doing, what are strategies to improve myself, levels, break it up, that you go from one to others, and you can also create a storyline, give it a narrative of what you're going through, and keep it interesting along all those paths if you go through the game, the curve of interest, make the final art, not always the final, aesthetics, make it also look pretty, and don't forget, allow people to fail, yes? Fail is an option in games, and you can learn from it to improve yourself, yes? That's our game mechanics. I hope you enjoyed the video, and see you in the next one.
